    <h1>SQLite and Python</h1>

    The SQLite is a simple library that allows you to create and manage databases from 
    within your Python application.
    Since SQLite is not a client-server RDBMS, there is no need to establish a connection to any 
    server.

    <h2>Creating a New Database</h2>
    Here is the code to create a new database.
    This will create a file named <TT>test.db</TT> in the same directory as the 
    Python script.
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-python">import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('test.db')</code></pre>

    <h2>Creating a New Table</h2>

    Once a new database is in place, we need to create the tables. 
    Here is a sample code to create a new table <TT>Employee</TT>.

    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-python">import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('test.db')

cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create the tables
try:
    print("Creating table Employee...")
    cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Employee(
        first_name VARCHAR(50),
        last_name VARCHAR(50),
        PRIMARY KEY(first_name, last_name)
        ) 
    ''')

except sqlite3.Error as error:
    print("An error occurred while creating the tables: {}".format(error))
finally:
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    print("The connection to the database is now closed")</code></pre>
Here is the explanation of the code:
<ul>
    <li> <b>Lines 8 to 17.</b> We execute the query to create the table <TT>Employee</TT>. 
    The function <TT>cursor.execute()</TT> takes a SQL query as its parameter.
    <li> <b>Lines 18-19.</b> This code is executed if the exception <TT>sqlite3.Error</TT> 
        is raised by the code in Lines 8-17.
    <li> <b>Lines 20-23.</b> This code is executed in any case, 
        whether the exception <TT>sqlite3.Error</TT> is raised or not.
</ul>
Note that in the <TT>try</TT> block you can write the code to create many tables, not just one as shown in the example.
<ul class="rtfm">
    <li class="rtfm"> Click <a href="./exceptions.html" target="_blank">here</a> to open the documentation on exceptions.
</ul>

<h2>Execute Queries</h2>

In order to execute a query, you can use the function <TT>execute</TT> of the 
object <TT>cursor</TT>.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-python">import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('test.db')

cursor = conn.cursor()

try:
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM Employee")
    result = cursor.fetchall()
    for row in result:
        first_name = row[0]
        last_name = row[1]
        print(first_name, last_name)

except sqlite3.Error as error:
    print("An error occurred while creating the tables: {}".format(error))
finally:
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    print("The connection to the database is now closed")</code></pre>

Explanation of the code:
<ul>
    <li> <b>Line 8.</b> Execute the query.
    <li> <b>Line 9.</b> Get the result of the query.
    <li> <b>Line 10-13.</b> For each row in the result, get the values in each column.
        Each row is a list of values (one value for each column).
</ul>

<h2>Execute Queries with Parameters</h2>

Sometimes, the values that you specify in a query are available
in variables of your Python code, and you might want to be able to
pass those variables to the query.
The following code retrieves from the database all employees whose last name
is <i>doe</i>.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-python">import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('test.db')

cursor = conn.cursor()
last_name = "doe"
try:
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE \
        last_name=?", (last_name,))
    result = cursor.fetchall()
    for row in result:
        first_name = row[0]
        last_name = row[1]
        print(first_name, last_name)
except sqlite3.Error as error:
    print("An error occurred while creating the tables: {}".format(error))
finally:
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    print("The connection to the database is now closed")</code></pre>
Here is the explanation of the code:
<ul>
<li> <b>Line 6.</b> The last name we search for is stored in a variable called <TT>last_name</TT>.
<li> <b>Lines 8-9.</b> The query is specified with one parameter indicated with <TT>?</TT>. The parameter is 
    a tuple that contains the list of the parameters to pass to the query. In this case, we only have 
    one parameter. <b>Don't forget the comma</b> after <TT>last_name</TT> otherwise the Python interpreter
    throws an error.
</ul>

In the following example, we look for exactly one employee 
with first name Michael and last name Doe:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-python">import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('test.db')

cursor = conn.cursor()
first_name="michael"
last_name = "doe"
try:
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE \
        first_name=? and last_name=?", (first_name, last_name))
    row = cursor.fetchone()
    first_name = row[0]
    last_name = row[1]
    print(first_name, last_name)
except sqlite3.Error as error:
    print("An error occurred while creating the tables: {}".format(error))
finally:
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    print("The connection to the database is now closed")</code></pre>
Here is the explanation of the code:
<ul>
    <li> <b>Line 9-10.</b> As before, but now the query takes two parameters.
    <li> <b>Line 11.</b> Instead of the function <TT>fetchall()</TT>, we use the function
    <TT>fetchone()</TT> to get exactly one row from the result.
</ul>

<h2>Execute INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE</h2>
This is achieved exactly in the same way as the SELECT queries.
The only difference is that at the end of the operation, you need to 
commit the modification to the database.
The following example inserts a new employee:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-python">import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('test.db')

cursor = conn.cursor()
first_name="New"
last_name = "Employee"
try:
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (?, ?)", (first_name, last_name))
except sqlite3.Error as error:
    print("An error occurred while creating the tables: {}".format(error))
finally:
    conn.commit()
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    print("The connection to the database is now closed")</code></pre>

Here is the explanation of the code:
<ul>
   <li> <b>Line 13.</b> Remember to commit the modifications.
</ul>
