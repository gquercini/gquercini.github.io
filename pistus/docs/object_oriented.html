    <h1>Object-Oriented Programming in Python</h1>

    <p><b>Object-oriented Programming (OOP)</b>
    is a <b>programming paradigm</b> that mandates that the structure of a program be 
    centered around the notion of <b>object</b>.
    The entities (e.g., persons, geometric figures, numbers) 
    manipulated in a OOP program are represented as <b>objects</b> 
    whose <b>properties</b> and <b>behavior</b> are specified in the definition of 
    <b>classes</b>.</p>

    <p>
    For instance, we can define a class 
    called <TT>Cat</TT> that describes the properties of any 
    cat (e.g., name and age) and a behavior (e.g., how fast a cat runs) 
    through the definition of <b>functions</b>, a.k.a as <b>methods</b> 
    in the OOP parlance. 
    The class is a model describing what a cat looks like; we can then <b>create</b> an object from the class
    that describes a particular <b>instance</b> of a cat (the one with name <i>mickey</i> and age 8 
    that runs slowly).
    </p>
    
    <h2>Defining a Class</h2>

    Below you'll find the code to define a class <TT>Cat</TT> 
    in Python with three properties: name, age and speed.
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-python">class Cat:

def __init__(self, name, age, speed):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
    self.speed = speed

def runs(self):
    if self.speed < 30:
        return "slow"
    else:
        return "fast"

@classmethod
def sound(cls):
    return "Meow"</code></pre>
Here is the explanation of the code:
<ul>
  <li> The method <TT>__init__</TT> is called the <b>constructor</b>  of the class
    and allows the creation of an instance (i.e., a specific cat) of the class.

  <li> The method <TT>runs</TT> is an <b>instance method</b>. This means that it can be 
    called on a specific object of the class. If the method is called on two different objects of the 
    class, the result of the method is likely to be different (two different cats might run at different speed). 
    The parameter <TT>self</TT> indicates that the method is called on an object.

  <li> The method <TT>sound</TT> is a <b>class method</b>. This means that it is 
    called on the class itself, and its result is always the same, for all objects of the class.
    All cats meow.
</ul>

<h2>Creating Objects</h2>

The following code creates two cats and then calls on both 
the method <TT>runs</TT>.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-python">first_cat = Cat("mickey", 10, 40)
second_cat = Cat("mouse", 16, 20)

print("The first cat is", first_cat.runs())
print("The second cat is", second_cat.runs())

print("All cats", Cat.sound())</code></pre>

Here is the explanation of the code:
<ul>
  <li> <b>Line 1.</b> Creates a new cat with name <i>mickey</i>, age 10 and speed 40.
  <li> <b>Line 2.</b> Creates a new cat with name <i>mouse</i>, age 16 and speed 20.
  <li> <b>Line 4.</b> Prints the string "The first cat is fast".
  <li> <b>Line 5.</b> Prints the string "The second cat is slow".
  <li> <b>Line 7.</b> Prints the string "All cats meow".    
</ul>
