should you run into problems 
with the implementation of the assignment.

:::


# Docker networking model

We developed a simple chat room in Python that you can download 
[here](/courses/cloud-computing/kube-lab/chat-room.zip). 
The code has been adapted from [this GitHub project](https://github.com/pricheal/python-client-server/){target="_blank"}.

Participants use a *client* program to connect to the chat room;
the chat room is managed by a *server* application  that receives the 
client connections and forwards the messages between the users.
The archive contains the following files:

* *client.py*. Implementation of the chat room client.
* *server.py*. Implementation of the chat room server.
* *utils.py*. Library with utility functions used in both *client.py* and *server.py*.

The application is written in Python and it **requires Python 3.7**. 
The application doesn't need any third-party library, the packages included in a minimal Python environment are enough.

**Exercise**


\BeginKnitrBlock{exercise}<div class="exercise"><span class="exercise" id="exr:client-server-methodology"><strong>(\#exr:client-server-methodology) </strong></span> 

a. Is a single Docker image for this application enough? Justify your answer.

b. Given your answer to the previous question, how many Docker images do you need to create? 
</div>\EndKnitrBlock{exercise}


:::



We now build the images for the application.

:::{.infobox .curiosity data-latex="curiosity"}
**Good to know**

If you need to inspect the file system of an
image that you create (e.g., to verify that the files that you 
copied are actually there), you can open a terminal 
in the image by using the following command:

``
docker run -it --entrypoint sh IMAGE_NAME
``

a. Upload the Dockerfile to Edunao.
b. Write the **exact** command that you used to build the image.
</div>\EndKnitrBlock{exercise}

::: {.infobox .warning data-latex="{warning}"}
**Warning**

The size of the images should be kept as small as possible.
Remember to include in the images only what you need to build and run the application.

:::

If you built more than one image:

c. Do they have some common layers? Which ones?

d. If so, is it something that has an impact on the build time and how?

## Client and server on the same network

We want to execute:

* One instance of the server.

* Two instances of the client.

The server, as well as the clients, will 
**run in Docker containers attached to the same network**.


::: {.infobox .exercisebox data-latex="{exercisebox}"}
**Exercise**

\BeginKnitrBlock{exercise}<div class="exercise"><span class="exercise" id="exr:unnamed-chunk-2"><strong>(\#exr:unnamed-chunk-2) </strong></span>
We want to make sure that:

1. The server and the clients can communicate with each other.

2. Other Docker containers **cannot** communicate neither with the server nor with the clients.  

How can you satisfy both requirements in Docker? Explain your solution 
and justify it.
</div>\EndKnitrBlock{exercise}

:::



::: {.infobox .warning data-latex="{warning}"}
**Warning**

Only one instance of the server is running. 
Two instances of the client run at the same time.

1. In order to execute the server, we need to **pass a port number as a parameter**. Choose one in the range [49152â€“65535].

2. In order to execute the client, we need to **pass as parameters the IP address of the server and the port** which the server listens to (the one that you specified at 1.).

:::

**Exercise**

\BeginKnitrBlock{exercise}<div class="exercise"><span class="exercise" id="exr:client-server-single-network"><strong>(\#exr:client-server-single-network) </strong></span>
Execute the server and the two clients by using the network configuration that you
explained in the previous exercise.

* The server writes messages on the terminal. Remember to launch the container with the appropriate 
options in order to actually see those messages.

* Users need to interact with the client, that is: read and write messages. 
Remember to launch the container with the appropriate options in order to actually see those messages.

Write the **exact commands** that you typed for 
both configuring the network and launching the server and the clients.  **Explain these commands.**
</div>\EndKnitrBlock{exercise}

:::



::: {.infobox .warning data-latex="{warning}"}
**Shut the application down!**

Shut both the clients and the server down  before you move on.

* On the client-side, type ``#quit`` at any moment to exit the chat room.

* Type Ctrl-C to stop the server.

:::


## Client and server on different networks

We want to execute:

* One instance of the server.

* Two instances of the client.

However, **neither client** is connected to the same network as the server.

::: {.infobox .exercisebox data-latex="{exercisebox}"}
**Exercise**


\BeginKnitrBlock{exercise}<div class="exercise"><span class="exercise" id="exr:unnamed-chunk-3"><strong>(\#exr:unnamed-chunk-3) </strong></span>
Why can't you launch the containers with the same settings as 
in Exercise \@ref(exr:client-server-single-network)?

What do you propose as a solution instead?

for both configuring the network and launching the server and the clients.
**Explain these commands.**

:::



::: {.infobox .warning data-latex="{warning}"}
**Shut the application down!**

Shut both the clients and the server down before you move on.

* On the client-side, type ``#quit`` at any moment to exit the chat room.

* Type Ctrl-C to stop the server.

# Multi-service application: Docker Compose

We intend to build and deploy the application *TripMeal*
by using **Docker Compose**. 
You can download the application 
[here](/courses/cloud-computing/kube-lab/tripmeal.zip).
The source code has been readapted from 
[this GitHub repository](https://github.com/DanielAndreasen/TripMeal){target="_blank"}.


The downloaded file is an archive. 
Extracting the archive will create a folder named 
``tripmeal_sujet``.

How many services does the application have?
Which technologies (i.e., programming languages, databases) are used in each service?
</div>\EndKnitrBlock{exercise}

:::




The ``Dockerfile`` in the directory ``db`` is already implemented.

Your goal here is to write a ``Dockerfile`` in the directory ``web``.

::: {.infobox .warning data-latex="{warning}"}
**In case you get Exec format error**

In order to avoid an ``Exec format error`` when you launch the application, 
you'll need to add to your Dockerfile an instruction:

``
RUN chmod -x path_to_file_app
``

where ``path_to_file_app`` is the path to the file ``app.py``
**inside the image**.

**Upload the Dockerfile to Edunao**.
</div>\EndKnitrBlock{exercise}

:::



In the folder ``tripmeal_sujet``, you'll find a file named ``tripmeal.env``.
It contains the definition of **environment variables** that 
are used in the application.

::: {.infobox .exercisebox data-latex="{exercisebox}"}
**Exercise**


\BeginKnitrBlock{exercise}<div class="exercise"><span class="exercise" id="exr:unnamed-chunk-8"><strong>(\#exr:unnamed-chunk-8) </strong></span>
Looking at the environment variables defined in file ``tripmeal.env``:

* What does SERVER_PORT refer to? A port opened at one of the host network interfaces or 
a port opened at one of the container's network interfaces? 

* Which environment variable tells you the name to assign to the database service?


Feel free to answer this question after deploying the application.

# Kubernetes cluster on Microsoft Azure

You're now going to create a Kubernetes cluster on **Microsoft Azure** 
and deploy *TripMeal* on that cluster.

::: {.infobox .warning data-latex="{warning}"}
**Warning**

In order to perform this activity, you need a **student subscription** on Microsoft Azure.
If you haven't activated it yet:

* Connect to [this webpage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/){target="_blank"}.

* Click on ``Start free``.

* Sign in by using your CentraleSupÃ©lec credentials.

* Follow the instructions.


:::

During this activity, you'll need to answer some questions that encourage you to 
gain a deeper knowledge of the Azure platform and better understand the commands that you type.
**Feel free to read the documentation on the Azure platform in order to answer the questions.**

## Login to Azure through CLI

::: {.infobox .warning data-latex="{warning}"}
**Warning**

If you get "command not found" when you type ``az``, it means that you haven't installed 
the Azure CLI yet. 
You'll find more information on the [Edunao course page](https://centralesupelec.edunao.com/course/view.php?id=4686#section-3){target="_blank"}.

Make sure you run version 2.25 or higher of the Azure CLI, by typing:

```
az --version
```

**If you use a VM with Multipass you'll need to install the Azure CLI with the following command:**

```
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
```

**If you use a VM either with Multipass or with VirtualBox you'll need to re-install kubectl:**

* Type the following command so as the command ``kubectl`` does not refer to ``minikube kubectl`` anymore:

```
unalias kubectl
```

* Type the following command to install a new version of ``kubectl``:

```
sudo az aks install-cli
```


:::

Whether you're on Windows, macOS or Linux, you need to **open a terminal**.

In order  to log in to your Azure account, type the following command:


```bash
az login
```

A Web page will open in your default Web browser, where you can type your username and 
password (your CentraleSupÃ©lec credentials).
After authenticating your Azure account, you can go back to the terminal, where you should see
some information about your account, such as:

```
[
  {
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
    "homeTenantId": "<id>",
    "id": "<id>",
    "isDefault": true,
    "managedByTenants": [],
    "name": "Azure for Students",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "<id>",
    "user": {
      "name": "<email-address>",
      "type": "user"
    }
  }
]
```

## Deploy and use Azure Container Registry

When we run TripMeal on a local Kubernetes cluster, we assumed that our computer
could have a direct access to the Internet and, therefore, to the DockerHub registry, where we 
could pull the images of the TripMeal services.
When we run a containerized application in production, we cannot make this assumption 
as the production servers have often no direct access to the Internet.

::: {.infobox .exercisebox data-latex="{exercisebox}"}
**Exercise**


\BeginKnitrBlock{exercise}<div class="exercise"><span class="exercise" id="exr:unnamed-chunk-19"><strong>(\#exr:unnamed-chunk-19) </strong></span>
In your view, why isn't it a good idea to have production servers directly 
connected to the Internet?
</div>\EndKnitrBlock{exercise}

:::



We need to place the images in a container registry that is in the same context 
as our production servers. 
Since we're going to run the application on Azure, we can use the 
**Azure Container Registry (ACR)**.

### Registry creation

First, we need to create a **resource group**.

::: {.infobox .exercisebox data-latex="{exercisebox}"}
**Exercise**


\BeginKnitrBlock{exercise}<div class="exercise"><span class="exercise" id="exr:unnamed-chunk-20"><strong>(\#exr:unnamed-chunk-20) </strong></span>
What is a **resource group** in Azure and how is it useful?
</div>\EndKnitrBlock{exercise}

:::




The command to create a new resource group is the following
(replace RES_GRP_NAME with a name of your choice).


```bash
az group create --name  RES_GRP_NAME --location francecentral
```

::: {.infobox .warning data-latex="{warning}"}
**Warning**

If ``francecentral`` does not work for your account, the previous command will normally suggest a possible location.
Choose one that is near you.

:::

You can verify that the resources are correctly created by looking [at the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/){target="_blank"}.

Next, we need to create a **container registry** with the following command
(replace RES_GRP_NAME with the name of your resource group and REG_NAME with a name of your choice for the registry).



```bash
az acr create --resource-group RES_GRP_NAME --name REG_NAME --sku Basic
```

::: {.infobox .exercisebox data-latex="{exercisebox}"}
**Exercise**

\BeginKnitrBlock{exercise}<div class="exercise"><span class="exercise" id="exr:unnamed-chunk-23"><strong>(\#exr:unnamed-chunk-23) </strong></span>
In the previous command, what does ``sku`` refer to?
Feel free to look up on the Azure website to find the answer.
</div>\EndKnitrBlock{exercise}

:::



### Registry login

After creating the registry, we can log into it with the following command:


```bash
az acr login --name REG_NAME
```

### Image tagging

We're almost ready to push the images that compose the application *TripMeal* to the registry.
In order to do that, we need to **tag** (i.e., rename) our images so that their names are 
preceded by the **login server name** of the registry.

In order to get the name of the **login server name** 
(that we denote here as ``acrloginserver``) of your registry, you can type 
the following command:


```bash
az acr list --resource-group RES_GRP_NAME --query "[].{acrLoginServer:loginServer}" --output table
```

Your ``acrloginserver`` will be something like ``xxx.azurecr.io``.

::: {.infobox .exercisebox data-latex="{exercisebox}"}
**Exercise**

\BeginKnitrBlock{exercise}<div class="exercise"><span class="exercise" id="exr:unnamed-chunk-26"><strong>(\#exr:unnamed-chunk-26) </strong></span>
Tag the images that correspond to the services of the  application *TripMeal* so that
their name is similar to: ``acrloginserver/nameofimage:latest``

Write the **exact Docker command** that you use to tag the images.
</div>\EndKnitrBlock{exercise}

:::



### Pushing the images

We can push the images with the following command (use your image name 
instead of ``xxx.azurecr.io/imagename:latest``).


```bash
docker push xxx.azurecr.io/imagename:latest
```

Make sure to **type this command for each image** that you want to push.

::: {.infobox .warning data-latex="{warning}"}
**Warning**

It might take few minutes before the images are completely pushed to the registry.

:::

Finally, verify that the images are actually in the registry with the following command:


```bash
az acr repository list --name REG_NAME --output table
```

Alternatively, you can connect to [your Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/){target="_blank"}
and visually browse your resources. 

## Deploy a Kubernetes cluster

We now deploy a **Kubernetes cluster on Azure**.

### Cluster creation

We create the cluster with the following command (replace CLUSTER_NAME 
with a name of your choice. As before, RES_GRP_NAME is the name of your resource group 
and REG_NAME is the name of the container registry).


```bash
az aks create \
    --resource-group RES_GRP_NAME \
    --name CLUSTER_NAME \
    --node-count 2 \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --attach-acr REG_NAME
```

::: {.infobox .warning data-latex="{warning}"}
**Warning**

If you get an error on your SSH key, then your key is not in the right format. 

Here is how we suggest you to proceed.

1. Open your home directory in Visual Studio.

2. Locate the hidden folder  ``.ssh``.

3. You should have a file named ``id_rsa.pub`` under folder ``.ssh``.  Open it.

4. Copy the whole content of the file.

5. Create a new file under folder ``.ssh``. Give it a name of your choice (for instance, ``id_kube_rsa.pub``).

6. Paste the content into the new file, while making sure that you don't have any whitespace before 
the first character.

7. Save and close the file.

8. Type the command ``az aks create`` and replace the ``--generate--ssh-keys`` option with ``--ssh-key-value ~/.ssh/id_kube_rsa.pub``.






:::

The cluster will take a while to start. Time for a coffee!
But before, answer the following question!

::: {.infobox .exercisebox data-latex="{exercisebox}"}
**Exercise**

\BeginKnitrBlock{exercise}<div class="exercise"><span class="exercise" id="exr:unnamed-chunk-30"><strong>(\#exr:unnamed-chunk-30) </strong></span>
Can you tell the meaning of the options in the previous command?
</div>\EndKnitrBlock{exercise}

:::



### Connect to the cluster

We can configure ``kubectl`` to connect to the newly created cluster.
You need to type the following command:


```bash
az aks get-credentials --resource-group RES_GRP_NAME --name CLUSTER_NAME
```

Now, your Kubernetes cluster should be visible locally.
To verify it, type the following command:


```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

Here *context* refers to the Kubernetes clusters that *kubectl* has access to.
The Kubernetes cluster that you created on Azure should be visible in the output; an asterisk
should appear in front of its name, indicating that it is the *current context* 
(that is the Kubernetes cluster being currently referenced by ``kubectl``).

Type the following command:


```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

You should see that the Kubernetes cluster has **two nodes**.

## Deploy the application 

We're almost done! The images are in the registry, the Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
The only missing piece of the puzzle is our application *TripMeal*.

First thing to do is to slightly modify the file ``tripmeal.yml`` that you created at the end
of the previous section.

::: {.infobox .exercisebox data-latex="{exercisebox}"}
**Exercise**

\BeginKnitrBlock{exercise}<div class="exercise"><span class="exercise" id="exr:unnamed-chunk-34"><strong>(\#exr:unnamed-chunk-34) </strong></span>
Look at the names of the images of each service in that file. How must these names change?
Modify the file accordingly (**no need to upload it on Edunao**).
</div>\EndKnitrBlock{exercise}

:::



It is the moment of truth! 
Deploy your application by typing the following command:


```bash
kubectl apply -f tripmeal.yml
```

Look at Kubernetes objects created after this command:


```bash
kubectl get all
```

Get the external IP address of the web service and try to connect to the application,
in the same way you did in the previous section.

If you can play with the application like you did in your local deployment it means that you reached 
the conclusion of this assignment! Bravo!

::: {.infobox .exercisebox data-latex="{exercisebox}"}
**Exercise**

\BeginKnitrBlock{exercise}<div class="exercise"><span class="exercise" id="exr:unnamed-chunk-37"><strong>(\#exr:unnamed-chunk-37) </strong></span>
Submit a **video** like that the one that [**you can see here**](https://webtv.centralesupelec.fr/permalink/v1261a00b74dbbzwk2vr/){target="_blank"}.

The video must **clearly** show that:

* You're connected to **your Azure portal** (Email address on the top right corner of the portal).

* All the passages that you see in the sample video: you need to show the **public IP address**
of the application that you deployed, use that address to connect to your application and play 
with the application to show that it works correctly.

</div>\EndKnitrBlock{exercise}
:::

The next exercise is **optional**.
Before you leave, **make sure to read the conclusion of this document!!**.


::: {.infobox .exercisebox data-latex="{exercisebox}"}
**Exercise**

\BeginKnitrBlock{exercise}<div class="exercise"><span class="exercise" id="exr:unnamed-chunk-38"><strong>(\#exr:unnamed-chunk-38) </strong></span>
The title of this exercise is *Cerise sur le gÃ¢teau* (aka, this is **optional**!).

At this point, you can connect to *TripMeal* by using an IP address. 
It would be nice if you could use a URL, like in the real websites.
Can you find a way to assign a URL to your web service? **Describe your procedure.**

You need a bit of Googling here....
</div>\EndKnitrBlock{exercise}

# Conclusion {-}

Make sure you follow these instructions:

* Take down your application in Kubernetes by using the following command:

```
kubectl delete -f tripmeal.yml
``` 

* Change the context of the ``kubectl`` command so that it points back 
to a local Kubernetes cluster. Type the following command, where 
CONTEXT_NAME will be ``docker-desktop`` or ``minikube``, depending on which local Kubernetes cluster 
you use.


```bash
kubectl config use-context CONTEXT_NAME
```

* **Destroy all the resources** linked to the application
*TripMeal* on Microsoft Azure, otherwise you'll get billed even if you don't use them!
You can destroy all the resources by simply deleting the resource group to which they belong.
You can do it through the Azure portal or by typing the following command (replace RES_GRP_NAME with the name
of the resource group that you intend to remove).

```
az group delete --name RES_GRP_NAME
```

* You can check the balance of your Azure credit [here](https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/Balance){target="_blank"}.

* You can stop Docker and Kubernetes if you don't need it anymore. -->
