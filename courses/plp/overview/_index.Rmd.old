# Overview

This course aims to introduce the main technologies 
to deal with the many challenges posed by **Big Data**.

Big Data is a term 
used to describe a collection of data 
that is huge in volume and 
yet grows exponentially over time. 
In short, this data is so voluminous and complex 
that none of the traditional data management tools are capable of 
*storing* or *processing* it efficiently.

In the first part, this course 
introduces the existing technologies 
that make it possible to efficiently 
**process** large volumes of data, namely **Hadoop MapReduce** and 
**Apache Spark**. 

In the second part, 
we will study the solutions that allow to 
**store** and **query** these volumes of data; 
we will focus on a variety of **NoSQL databases** 
(using **MongoDB**  as a  case study).
