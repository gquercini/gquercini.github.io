In this page you'll find instructions to install MongoDB on your computer.

# Instructions for MacOS users

You'll need to use commands in the Terminal to install MongoDB.

## Prerequisites

* Install **XCode**. You'll find it for free in the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12){target="_blank"}.

* Install **Homebrew**, a command-line utility that let's you install several software applications. Type the following command in 
the Terminal:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

* Install **MongoDB Compass**, a MongoDB **client** that communicates with a MongoDB **server** and lets you manipulate 
your MongoDB databases through a graphical interface. 
You'll find the installer package [at this page](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass){target="_blank"}.


## Installation

You can watch the following video that details how to install MongoDB, 
start the server and connect to the server through MongoDB Compass.
