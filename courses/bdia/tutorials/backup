**Exercise**

```{exercise}

Look at the cardinalities between the entities <TT>rental</TT> and <TT>payment</TT>
in Figure \@ref(fig:sakila-model). 
Is it wise to create two separate collections for rentals and payments? Why?
What do you propose instead?

The relationship between the two given entities is **one-to-one**.
It would not be wise to keep the same normalized schema as in the relational database, 
because that would require us to use a join operation at query time. 
Besides, with this schema, a rental might not be stored on the same node as the relative 
payment, which would make the join operation even more costly.

A denormalized schema here is more appropriate.
In fact, since each payment is relative to one and only one rental, 
the information about the payment is stored only once, therefore there is no redundancy.

Therefore, we choose to embed the information about a payment into the corresponding 
rental document.
