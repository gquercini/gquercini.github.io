For more information, see Virtualization.\nVirtualBox users\nDocker for Windows uses Hyper-V as a virtual machine to run containers. Unfortunately, Hyper-V and VirtualBox are not compatible; when Hyper-V is enabled, VirtualBox will stop working.\nHowever:\nThe existing VirtualBox images will not be removed.\nWhen you want to use VirtualBox, you can turn Hyper-V off.\nCannot/don’t want to install Docker Desktop for for Windows\nIf your computer doesn’t meet the hardware requirements, or you don’t want to install Docker Desktop for Windows because you don’t want to mess up your VirtualBox installation (although you shouldn’t really worry about the latter), you have two options:\nInstall Docker Toolbox for Windows (Section 1.2).\nSee the alternative options (Section 4).\nInstallation procedure\nDownload Docker Desktop for Windows.\nFollow the installation instructions. You might need to restart the system to enable Hyper-V.\nVerify your installation (see Section 5).\n1.2 Docker Toolbox for Windows If your computer runs Windows 7 or higher, and doesn’t meet the hardware requirements for Docker for Windows, you can install Docker Toolbox for Windows.\nShow me more\nPlease refer to these installation instructions.\nCannot install Docker Toolbox\nSee the alternative options (Section 4). 2 MacOS The installation procedure depends on the version of MacOS running on your computer.\n2.1 Docker Desktop for Mac. If your computer runs MacOS 10.13 or higher, you can install Docker Desktop for Mac (recommended).\nShow me more\nHardware requirements\nYour computer hardware must be a 2010 or a newer model. Verify that your computer is compatible with Docker Desktop for Mac: Open a terminal. Run the following command: sysctl kern.hv_support. If the output of the command is kern.hv_support: 1 your computer is compatible. At least 4GB of RAM. VirtualBox users\nIf you have a version of VirtualBox older than 4.3.30, you should consider upgrading it, as it would not be compatible with Docker Desktop.\nCannot install Docker Desktop for Mac\nIf your computer doesn’t meet the hardware requirements, you have two options:\nInstall Docker Toolbox for Mac (Section 2.2).\nSee the alternative options (Section 4).\nInstallation instructions\nDownload Docker Desktop for Mac.\nFollow the installation instructions.\nVerify your installation (see Section 5).\n2.2 Docker Toolbox for Mac If your computer runs MacOs 10.8 or higher, and doesn’t meet the hardware requirements for Docker Desktop for Mac, you can install Docker Toolbox for Mac.\nShow me more\nPlease refer to these installation instructions.\nCannot install Docker Toolbox\nSee the alternative options (Section 4). 3 Linux You can install Docker on the following Linux distributions:\nCentOS (installation instructions).\nDebian (installation instructions).\nFedora (installation instructions).\nUbuntu (installation instructions).\nMake sure to read the post-installation steps for Linux and to take the necessary steps to be able to run Docker as a non-root user.\n4 Alternative options If you’re unable to install Docker on your computer, you have two options left: using the Docker playground or installing Docker in a Linux virtual machine.\n4.1 Docker playground The Docker playground is an online Docker environment that you can play with for free.\nThe advantage is that you don’t have anything to install on your computer.\nThe disadvantage is that you might be unable to open a session depending on the number of active sessions.\nIn order to connect to the playground, you need to create an account on DockerHub.\n4.2 Docker in an already prepared virtual machine We provide an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine (5GB) with Docker and Kubernetes already installed. Download the virtual machine. You’ll need your CentraleSupélec credentials to access the file. Follow the installation procedure that is detailed in this video.\n5 Verify your installation Open a terminal and type the following command:\ndocker run hello-world If everything is OK, you should see the output in the following figure.\n6 Interacting with Docker In this course, we’ll learn how to interact with the Docker engine by using the command-line terminal. This option might seem a bit tedious (nobody likes to remember textual commands), but it offers a great flexibility.\nThis is the option that we recommend and for which we’ll provide a full support throughout the course.\n6.1 Graphical interface If you really want to use a graphical interface, you might want to look at Portainer, which is itself run as a Docker container.\nLinux or MacOS users\nOpen a terminal and copy and paste the following commands:\ndocker volume create portainer_data docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9000:9000 --name=portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer Windows users Open a terminal and copy and paste the following commands:\ndocker volume create portainer_data docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9000:9000 --name portainer --restart always -v \\\\.\\pipe\\docker_engine:\\\\.\\pipe\\docker_engine -v portainer_data:C:\\data portainer/portainer When the container is up and running, the interface is available at the following URL: http://localhost:9000.\nChoose a password and create the user admin.\nSelect Local to manage the Docker environment installed on your computer and click on Connect.\nClick on the endpoint Local (figure below) to access the dashboard.\nThe menu on the left of the dashboard allows you to manage the different components of your Docker environment (e.g., containers, images, volumes and networks). A user guide of Portainer is very much out of the scope of this course. However, the interface is rather intuitive and you should easily find out how to create, run, stop and remove containers, build images and create volumes and networks.\n7 Troubleshooting In this section we’ll document the installation issues that you might experience.\nDon’t hesitate to contact us to report your installation problems.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"1009f24f18a9853858a69a79adeb4f0c","permalink":"/courses/cloud-computing/overview/installing-docker/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/cloud-computing/overview/installing-docker/","section":"courses","summary":"Docker installation instructions","tags":null,"title":"Installing Docker","type":"docs"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1581344688,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581344688,"objectID":"4e459ff727a9e6a0c795e8d8f3d69232","permalink":"/project/data-for-you/","publishdate":"2020-02-10T15:24:48+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/data-for-you/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Data for You","type":"project"},{"authors":["Armita Khajeh Nassiri","Nathalie Pernelle","Fatiha Saı̈s","Gianluca Quercini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"77dcf9b15a66ddb64a7a8426a803dd21","permalink":"/publication/nassiri-2020/","publishdate":"2020-11-05T15:51:37.231059Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nassiri-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Generating Referring Expressions from RDF Knowledge Graphs for Data Linking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fatiha Saïs","Joana E.

with the answer to the questions that you find in this document.\nPlease send me the zip file by email.\nThe submission deadline is Thursday, May 20, 2021 8:00 AM.\n1 Computing averages We consider a collection of CSV files containing temperature measurements in the following format:\nyear,month,day,hours,minutes,seconds,temperature\nyou can find the files under the directory hdfs://sar01:9000/data/temperatures/\nHere are the details for each file:\nFile temperatures_86400.csv contains one measurement per day in the years 1980 - 2018. File temperatures_2880.csv contains one measurement every 2880 seconds in the years 1980 - 2018. File temperatures_86.csv contains one measurement every 86 seconds for the year 1980 alone. File temperatures_10.csv contains one measurement every 10 seconds for the years 1980 - 2018. We intend to implement a Spark algorithm to generate pairs \\((y, t_{avg})\\), where \\(y\\) is the year and \\(t_{avg}\\) is the average temperature in the year.\n1.1 First implementation Copy the file ~vialle/DCE-Spark/template_temperatures.py to your home directory by typing the following command:\ncp ~vialle/DCE-Spark/template_temperatures.py ./avg_temperatures_first.py Open the file avg_temperatures_first.py and write the following function:\ndef avg_temperature(theTextFile): temperatures = theTextFile \\ .map(lambda line: line.split(\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;)) \\ .map(lambda term: (term[0], [float(term[6])])) \\ .reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x+y) \\ .mapValues(lambda lv: sum(lv)/len(lv)) return temperatures In the same file, locate the two variables input_path and output-path. and write the following code:\ninput_path = \u0026quot;hdfs://sar01:9000/data/temperatures/\u0026quot; output_path = \u0026quot;hdfs://sar01:9000/cpuecm1/cpuecm1_XX/\u0026quot; Don’t forget the / at the end of the file paths and to replace XX with the number at the end of your username.\nExercise\nExercise 1.1 Run the script avg_temperatures_first.py by using temperatures_86400.csv as an input. To this extent, use the following command: spark-submit --master spark://sar01:7077 avg_temperatures_first.py temperatures_86400.csv You should find the output of the program under the folder\nhdfs://sar01:9000/cpuecm1/cpuecm1_XX/temperatures_86400.out\nWhat’s the execution time? In the output of Spark on the command line you should see a line that mentions something along the following line: INFO DAGScheduler: Job 0 finished: runJob at SparkHadoopWriter.scala:78, took 3.478220 s Run the same script by using temperatures_2880.csv as an input.\nWhat is the execution time? Does it seem reasonable compared with the execution time that you observed before? Justify your answer.\nExecute the same script by using temperatures_86.csv as an input.\nWhat is the execution time? How would you justify it, knowing that the files temperatures_2880.csv and temperatures_86.csv have a similar size (11 MB the former, 9 MB the latter)?\n```\n1.2 Second implementation Copy the file ~vialle/DCE-Spark/template_temperatures.py to your working directory by typing the following command:\ncp ~vialle/DCE-Spark/template_temperatures.py ./avg_temperatures_second.py Exercise\nExercise 1.2 Based on the observations made in the previous exercise, write an improved implementation of the function avg_temperature.\nExercise\nExercise 1.3 Run the script avg_temperatures_second.py by using temperatures_86.csv as an input.\nWhat’s the execution time? Compare it with the execution time obtained in the previous exercise and comment the difference.\nRun the same script by using temperatures_10.csv (3 GB!) as an input. Do you think that the program takes too long? Why?\n2 Common friends in a social network Consider a social network described by a graph encoded in a text file. Each line of the file is a list of identifiers separated by commas. For instance, the line \\(A,B,C,D\\) means that \\(A\\) is friend with \\(B\\), \\(C\\) and \\(D\\). An excerpt of the file looks like as follows:\nA,B,C,D B,A,D C,A,D D,A,B,C ... We suppose that the friendship relation is symmetric: \\((A, B)\\) implies \\((B, A)\\).\nWe want to obtain the list of the common friends for each pair of individuals:\n(A, B), [D] (A, C), [D] (A, D), [B, C] (B, C), [D] (B, D), [A] (C, D), [A] As an additional constraint, we want to represent a couple only once and avoid to represent the symmetric couple. In other words, if we output \\((A, B)\\), we don’t want to output \\((B, A)\\).\nWe use the following input files available in folder hdfs://sar01:9000/data/sn/:\nsn_tiny.csv. Small social network, that you can use to test your implementation.\nsn_10k_100k.csv. Social network with \\(10^4\\) individuals and \\(10^5\\) links.\nsn_100k_100k.csv. Social network with \\(10^5\\) individuals and \\(10^5\\) links.\nsn_1k_100k.csv. Social network with \\(10^3\\) individuals and \\(10^5\\) links.\nsn_1m_1m.csv. Social network with \\(10^6\\) individuals and \\(10^6\\) links.\nExercise\nExercise 2.1 Write an implementation in Spark. Test your implementation on file sn_tiny.csv.\nExercise\nExercise 2.2 Run your implementation on the other files and write down the execution times. Comment on the execution times considering the file sizes, the number of nodes and links and the number of pairs \\(((A, B), X)\\) generated by the algorithm.\nExercise\nExercise 2.3 By using a MapReduce-style algorithm, write a Spark program to compute the minimum, maximum and average degree of a node in a given graph.\nCompute the minimum, maximum and average degree on all the given input files.\nDo these values confirm or invalidate the considerations that you made on the execution times of the algorithm in the first exercise? Justify your answer.\n3 Creating an inverted index In folder hdfs://sar01:9000/data/bbc/ you’ll find a collection of 50 articles obtained from the BBC website (2004-2005) organized into five subfolders: business, entertainment, politics, sport and technology.\nWe want to create an inverted index, which associates each word with the list of the files in which the word occurs. More specifically, for each word, the inverted index will have a list of the names of the files (path relative to the folder /data/bbc) that contain the word.\nThe inverted index:\nmust not contain the same word twice;\nmust not contain any stopwords (the list of stopwords is provided in the hdfs://sar01:9000/data/stopwords.txt file);\nMoreover:\nWords in the inverted index must only contain letters.\nWords in the inverted index must be lowercase.\nExercise\nExercise 3.1 Write a Spark program to create an inverted index and execute it on the input folder. You can use the template available at ~vialle/DCE-Spark/template_inverted_index.py.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"76158ebb08d6aa7e40a693d348db00e7","permalink":"/courses/big-data-marseille/tutorials/spark-assignment/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/big-data-marseille/tutorials/spark-assignment/","section":"courses","summary":"Lab assignment Spark RDD.","tags":null,"title":"Apache Spark — Programming with RDD","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" 1 Number of partitions in a RDD We consider a set of CSV files that contain temperature measurements over several years. Each line has the following content: year,month,day,hour,minute,second,temperature.\nThese files are stored at the following location: hdfs://sar17:9000/data/temperatures/.\nHere is the detail for each file:\nFile temperatures_86400.csv contains one measurement per day between 1980 and 2018. File temperatures_2880.csv contains one measurement every 2880 seconds between 1980 and 2018. File temperatures_86.csv contains one measurement every 86 seconds for the year 1980 alone. File temperatures_10.csv contains one measurement every 10 seconds between 1980 - 2018. Get the file avg_temperatures_rdd.py by typing the following command:\ncp /usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/spark-sql-templates/avg_temperatures_rdd.py .

HINT. If you divide the size of the file temperatures_10.csv by the number of partitions of the RDD text_file, which value do you obtain? What does this value represent?\nList the files that are stored in the output folder temperatures_10.rdd.out under your HDFS folder. What do you notice? Is there any relation with respect to the number of partitions?\nGood to know\nIn order to list the content of the folder in HDFS, you can use the following command:\nhdfs dfs -ls hdfs://sar17:9000/bdiaspark22/bdiaspark22_XX/temperatures_10.rdd.out 2 Using the DataFrame API to compute the average temperatures You’re now going to implement a Spark program to compute the average temperatures by using the Spark DataFrame API.\nGo through the following steps:\nCopy the code template avg_temperatures_df.py to your home folder by executing the following command: cp /usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/spark-sql-templates/avg_temperatures_df.py . The instructions at line 84 and 90 show the number of partitions of the RDDs underlying the dataframes df (input) and df_avg (output) respectively.\nThe result of the computation will be stored in the folder temperatures_*.df.out under your HDFS folder bdiaspark22/bdiaspark22_XX\nExercise\nExercise 2.1 Complete the code by following the instructions that you find in file avg_temperatures_df.py.\nExecute your code on all the input CSV files and complete Table 2.

RDDs vs. DataFrames. Exercise\nExercise 2.2 Compare the execution times with the ones obtained with the implementation using the RDDs. What do you observe?\nWhat is the number of partition of the output RDD? How do you explain this value? 2.1 Effect of the number of partitions You’re going to study the effect of the number of partitions on the performances of the program.\nIn file avg_temperatures_df.py add the following instruction right below the initialisation of the SparkSession. The command sets the number of shuffle partitions to a certain value X. spark.conf.set(\u0026quot;spark.sql.shuffle.partitions\u0026quot;, X)\nExecute the program with different values of X (say, 1, 2, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 100000) only on file temperatures_86400.csv and write down the execution times. Exercise\nExercise 2.3 Plot a graph where the x-axis contains the values of X and the y-axis contains the execution time. What do you observe?\nExecute the program on the other files by using small values of X (1 and 2). Comment on the evolution of the execution times. 2.2 Caching a DataFrame You’re now going to discover the advantages of caching a DataFrame.\nAt the end of file avg_temperatures_df.py, add the following instruction: df_avg.show(n=5)\nExercise\nExercise 2.4 What does this instruction? Is it a transformation or an action?\nRemove the file temperatures_10.df.out by typing the following command: hdfs dfs -rm -r hdfs://sar17:9000/bdiaspark22/bdiaspark22_XX/temperatures_10.df.out Exercise\nExercise 2.5 Execute the code on file temperatures_10.csv. Why do we have two jobs (job 0 and 1)? What is the execution time of each job?\nRemove again the file temperatures_10.df.out by typing the following command:\nLocate the instruction:\ndf_avg.write.csv(output_folder) and add the following instruction right below: df_avg.cache()\nExercise\nExercise 2.6 Execute the code on file temperatures_10.csv. What is the execution time of the different jobs? Which execution model does Spark follow?\n3 Computing averages with SQL You’re now going to implement the computation of the yearly average temperatures by using SQL on Spark DataFrames.\n3.1 Using a view A first option to query a DataFrame with SQL is to create a view.\nCopy the file avg_temperatures_sql_view.py to your home folder by typing the following command: cp /usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/spark-sql-templates/avg_temperatures_sql_view.py . Complete the code by following the instructions that you find in the file. Exercise\nExercise 3.1 Execute the code on all CSV files and complete Table 3. As the number of shuffle partitions, just use the default value.\nCompare the running times with those that you obtained in the previous exercises. File Execution time RDD\n(sec) Execution time DataFrame\n(sec) Execution time SQL view\n(sec) temperatures_86400.csv 2.71 4.75 4.59 temperatures_2880.csv 3.27 4.52 4.54 temperatures_86.csv 4.33 Exercise 2.1 temperatures_10.csv Exercise 1.1 Exercise 2.1 Table 3. RDDs vs DataFrames with views. 3.2 Using a table A second option to query a DataFrame with SQL is to create a table.\nCopy the file avg_temperatures_sql_table.py to your home directory by typing the following command: cp /usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/spark-sql-templates/avg_temperatures_sql_table.py . Complete the code by following the instructions that you find in the file.\nRemove all the folders *.sql.out.\nExercise\nExercise 3.2 Execute the code on file temperatures_86400.csv. How many jobs do you have?\nWhat does each job correspond to? What is the execution time of each job?\nHow do you explain that we only got one job when we used a view? While reading the code in file avg_temperatures_sql_table.py, you probably noticed that we have specified the path to a HDFS folder for the Hive metastore warehouse. This folder will contain the data of each table that we create.\nExercise\nExercise 3.3 Look at the files in your home folder (in the local file system, not HDFS) by using the command ls.\nDo you notice the presence of new files?\nCan you explain what these files are?\nExecute the code on all CSV files and complete Table 4.\nCompare the execution times against the ones that you obtained in the previous exercises. File Execution time RDD\n(sec) Execution time DataFrame\n(sec) Execution time SQL view\n(sec) Execution time SQL table\n(sec) temperatures_86400.csv 2.71 4.75 4.59 4.66 temperatures_2880.csv 3.27 4.52 4.54 4.36 temperatures_86.csv 4.33 Exercise 2.1 Exercise 3.1 temperatures_10.csv Exercise 1.1 Exercise 2.1 Exercise 3.1 Table 4. RDDs vs DataFrames with views and tables. Remove the file temperatures_10.sql.out and execute the code again on file temperatures_10.csv. Exercise\nExercise 3.4 How many jobs do we have? Why?\nWhat is the execution time of each job? 4 Using the DataFrame API on large files We now consider the files stored under hdfs://sar17:9000/data/sales/.\nThese files contain tabular data related to the sale of products in a chain of stores. We consider two tables: store_sales and customer. In the first table we find information about each sale, such as the identifier of the product sold, the identifier of the buyer, the quantity of purchased product and the price paid by the customer. For this table, we have 4 files, which only differ in size:\nstore_sales_.100.dat: contains 9.5 GiB of data.\nstore_sales_.200.dat: contains 19 GiB of data.\nstore_sales_.400.dat: contains 38 GiB of data.\nstore_sales_.800.dat: contains 77 GiB of data.\nIn table customer we find data about customers, such as first and last names and birth dates. We only have one file for this table:\ncustomer_10000.dat: contains 8.3 GiB of data. We want to test the performances of the DataFrame API on the following queries (WARNING. you must write a code that uses DataFrame functions, not SQL!):\nQuery Q1: returns the number of clients. This corresponds to the following SQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM customer Query Q2: returns the price of the most expensive product. This corresponds to the following SQL query:\nSELECT max(ss_list_price) FROM store_sales Query Q3: returns the amount of money spent by each client. This corresponds to the following SQL query:\nSELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(ss_net_paid_inc_tax) as amountSpent FROM store_sales GROUP BY ss_customer_sk Query Q4: Query Q3 + sort the result so that the client that spent the most money appears on the top. This corresponds to the following SQL query:\nSELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(ss_net_paid_inc_tax) as amountSpent FROM store_sales GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY amountSpent DESC Query Q5: Query Q4 + join with the table customer to get the first and last name of the customers. This corresponds to the following SQL query:\nSELECT c.c_first_name, c.c_last_name, SUM(ss_net_paid_inc_tax) as amountSpent FROM store_sales s JOIN customer c ON s.ss_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY amountSpent DESC 4.1 Development of the code using the DataFrame API. Copy the file dataframe_api_benchmark.py to your home directory by typing the following command: cp /usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/spark-sql-templates/dataframe_api_benchmark.py . Modify the code by following the instructions in the file.\nExecute the code on file store_sales_100.dat (the smallest one) to test that your code is bug-free.\nOnce you’re sure that your code is correct, uncomment lines 82 and 83. This will cache the two DataFrames.\nExecute the code on all files store-sales_*.dat\nGood to know\nEach query is executed 5 times to have a correct estimate of the execution time. You’ll see that the execution times fluctuate on the first iterations and they stabilize in the later iterations. When you write down the execution times, only consider the execution times obtained at the last iteration.\nExercise\nExercise 4.1 Complete Table 5 and write down the execution time of each query for each file.\nWhy the execution time of the queries Q1 and Q2 is large at the iteration 0?\nDo you think that the difference between the execution times of the queries is reasonable?\nDo you think that the augmentation of the execution times is reasonable given the size of the input files?\nFile / query Read\n(sec) Query Q1\n(sec) Query Q2\n(sec) Query Q3\n(sec) Query Q4\n(sec) Query Q5\n(sec) store_sales_1_4.100.dat 17.24 0.94 1.05 1.17 2.16 5.22 store_sales_1_4.200.dat store_sales_1_4.400.dat store_sales_1_4.800.dat Table 5. Execution times of the queries on the sales dataset. Good to know\nCompared with the previous exercises, you’ll notice that Spark prints out less messages. This is the effect of the instruction on line 46 (Spark only prints out some of the information messages at the beginning of the computation and any error message). You’ll be able to easily find the execution times of the queries.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"5f8a9e6d0e9ea85d7fa3b7ca4dfa4431","permalink":"/courses/bdia/tutorials/spark-sql-assignment/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/bdia/tutorials/spark-sql-assignment/","section":"courses","summary":"Description of the assignment on Spark SQL","tags":null,"title":"Spark DataFrames and Spark SQL","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Lecture 1 Title: Introduction and MapReduce programming.\nSlides: Available on Edunao.\nLecture 2 Title: Hadoop and storage: HDFS.\nSlides: Available on Edunao.\nLecture 3 Title: Introduction to Apache Spark.\nSlides: Available on Edunao.\nLecture 4 Title: Spark SQL.\nLecture 5 Title: Spark Streaming\nLecture 6 Title: Distributed and NoSQL databases\nLecture 7 Title: Document-oriented database systems: MongoDB.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b2794a92549814a9265f32990f791e8c","permalink":"/courses/bdia_old/lectures/lectures/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/bdia_old/lectures/lectures/","section":"courses","summary":"Presenting the lectures.","tags":null,"title":"Lectures","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Both lab assignments will be graded.\nLab assignment 1 Title: Multi-service applications in the Cloud\nSupervisors: Francesca Bugiotti Gianluca Quercini, Arpad Rimmel, Idir Ait Sadoune, Marc-Antoine Weisser\nDate and time: Friday 7 May, 1:45 PM - 5 PM\nRoom: On Microsoft Teams\nLink: Click here\nLab assignment 2 Title: MapReduce - Apache Spark\nSupervisors: Francesca Bugiotti Gianluca Quercini, Arpad Rimmel, Idir Ait Sadoune, Marc-Antoine Weisser\nDate and time: Friday 28 May, 1:45 PM - 5 PM\nRoom: Remotely on Microsoft Teams\nLink: available soon\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6e75e11c1ee6ba55693a9622583beaf9","permalink":"/courses/cloud-computing/labs/cc-labs/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/cloud-computing/labs/cc-labs/","section":"courses","summary":"Presentation of the lab assignments of the course.","tags":null,"title":"Lab assignments","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Lecture 1 Title: Introduction to Cloud Computing\nLecturer: Gianluca Quercini\nDate and time: Wednesday 14 April, 8:30 AM - 11:45 AM\nRoom: Remotely on Microsoft Teams\nSlides: Available on Edunao.\nLecture 2 Title: Virtualization and Containerization\nLecturer: Gianluca Quercini (CentraleSupélec)\nDate and time: Friday 16 April, 1:45 PM - 5 PM\nRoom: Remotely on Microsoft Teams\nSlides: Available on Edunao.\nLecture 3 Title: Multi-service applications and orchestration\nLecturer: Gianluca Quercini (CentraleSupélec)\nDate and time: Friday 23 April, 1:45 PM - 5:00 PM\nRoom: Remotely on Microsoft Teams\nSlides: Available on Edunao.\nLecture 4 Title: MapReduce\nLecturer: Francesca Bugiotti (CentraleSupélec)\nDate and time: Friday 14 May, 1:45 PM - 5:00 PM\nRoom: Remotely on Microsoft Teams\nSlides: Available here\nLecture 5 Title: Apache Spark\nLecturer: Francesca Bugiotti (CentraleSupélec)\nDate and time: Tuesday 18 May, 8:30 AM - 11:45 AM\nRoom: Remotely on Microsoft Teams\nSlides: Available here\nLecture 6 Title: Arrow - Spark + Argo\nLecturer: Francesca Bugiotti (CentraleSupélec)\nDate and time: Wednesday 26 May, 8:30 AM - 11:45 AM\nRoom: Remotely on Microsoft Teams\nSlides: Available soon\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"4f5a608bccc37bec35254441f7fcae9a","permalink":"/courses/cloud-computing/lectures/lectures/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/cloud-computing/lectures/lectures/","section":"courses","summary":"Presenting the lectures.","tags":null,"title":"Lectures","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Class material Lecture slides, available here.\nAn introduction to Docker.\nA Docker cheat sheet, with a summary of the most important Docker commands.\nAn introduction to Linux, useful to understand how Docker works and how to interact with Docker.\nBooks Schenker, Gabriel.

Only one submission per group is possible. Two members of the same group cannot submit two different versions. You must submit three files, please follow these instructions:\nA report in PDF containing the answers to all the questions and exercises, except the SQL queries (max 10 pages). Please name the file groupXX_report.pdf, where XX is your group number.\nA file containing the PostgreSQL database that you generated. Please name the file groupXX_db.sql. To generate this file, please watch this video.\nA file with all the SQL queries. Please name the file groupXX_queries.sql. Separate each query in the file by a blank line.\nExample:\nSELECT * FROM Airport SELECT * FROM Hotel Each group must submit an original work. Edunao is equipped with an anti-plagiarism tool that is able to check the originality of each submission. Submissions that are flagged as too similar by the tool are likely to be discarded and will not be evaluated.\nApplication context We intend to manage the data of a travel reservation system with clients all over the world. Upon registration, customers are automatically given a numeric identifier and they are asked to indicate their first and family names, their gender, date of birth, a phone number, an email address and their country of residence.\nAny customer can book a trip that includes the reservation of one or more flights and, possibly, one or more hotels.\nExample\nAlice wants to fly from Paris, France to New York City (NYC), USA and she intends to stay in NYC for 10 days. Her trip includes two flights: an outbound flight from Paris to NYC and an inbound flight from NYC to Paris; and an hotel in NYC.\nA flight is operated by an airline company, of which the system keeps its name (e.g., British Airways), the country where the airline is incorporated and, when available, its IATA code (e.g., BA, a two-letter code identifying the airline), its ICAO code (e.g., BAW, a three-letter code identifying the airline) and alternate name or alias (e.g., British).\nA flight connects two airports, each having a name (e.g., London Heathrow Airport), and, possibly, a IATA (e.g., LHR) and ICAO code (e.g., EGLL); an airport serves a specific location (e.g., London, UK) and its precise position is given by its geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).\nA flight connecting two airports at specific departure and arrival times is identified by a flight number. Two flights operated by two different airline companies cannot have the same flight number, but the same flight number can denote two flights operated by the same airline company on different days.\nExample\nEmirates flight EK074 leaves Paris, France at 10 AM and arrives at Dubai, UAE at 7:40 PM (regardless of the departure day).\nFor each flight booked by a customer, the system keeps the seat number, the travel class (e.g., economy or business), the price and the date of the flight. Usually, airlines include details on the type of aircraft they plan to use on their flight schedules; these details include the name of the aircraft (e.g., Boeing 787-8) and, when available, the IATA code (e.g., 788, a unique three-letter identifier for the aircraft) and the ICAO code (e.g., B788, a unique four-letter identifier for the aircraft).\nThe system maintains a list of hotels, with their names, addresses and an average review score, which is a real number denoting the average grade assigned to the hotel by its customers. Customers can write a review for an hotel; in which case the system stores the text of the review, the date and its author. When a customer books an hotel, the system keeps the price paid, the check-in and check-out dates and whether the breakfast is included.\nThe dataset You can download the dataset by clicking here. The dataset consists of 7 CSV files: aircrafts.csv, airlines.csv, airports.csv, hotels.csv, customers.csv, hotel_bookings.csv, flight_bookings.csv. The separator character in each file is the tab character (‘’).\nNotice\nTake some time to look at the content of the files to understand the structure that your tables will have.\nYou can open CSV files in Excel.\nCreation of a relational database You’ll now proceed to the definition of a relational database for our travel reservation system. First, you need to define the conceptual schema and then you’ll define the tables that compose the database.\nThe conceptual schema Before defining the logical schema of the database, answer the following questions:\nCan you use the name of the hotel as a primary key? Justify your answer.\nCan you use the flight number as a primary key to identify a flight? Justify your answer and, in case of a negative answer, propose a solution.\nKnowing that it is unlikely that two reviews have the same textual content, would you use it as a primary key? Justify your answer.\nKnowing that the IATA code uniquely identifies an airport, would you choose it as a primary key for the entity Airport? Justify your answer.\nExercise\nExercise 1 Propose an Entity-Relationship diagram describing the conceptual model of a relational database for the given application context.\nSpecify all the attributes for each entity and relation.\nFor each entity, underline the attributes composing the primary key.\nFor each relation, clearly indicate the minimum and maximum cardinality. Normalization Exercise\nExercise 2 Translate the logical schema into a collection of tables. For each table:\nIndicate its name and the names of the columns (but not their types).\nUnderline the columns that are part of the primary key.\nIndicate the entity in the ER diagram to which the table corresponds.\nTo make sure you choose the right data types for the columns, you can also check the values in the dataset.\nWhich normal form are your tables in?\nExercise\nExercise 3 For each table:\nIndicate a minimal set of functional dependencies.\nIndicate the normal form that the table satisfies. Justify your answer. Normalize your tables.\nExercise\nExercise 4 Normalize each table up to the Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF).\nThe physical schema You can now define the physical schema of your database.\nExercise\nExercise 5 Write the SQL code to create the tables. For each table:\nIndicate the primary key.\nIndicate the foreign keys.\nIndicate NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints, if needed. Database creation and data import If you followed the normalization steps correctly, it is unlikely that you can import the data directly from the given CSV files.\nYou need a CSV file per table to import the data into your database.\nCreating the CSV files\nUse Excel to rearrange the data from the input CSV files, so as to create one CSV per table.\nMake sure you save the files as CSV with UTF-8 encoding.\nWatch this video to learn how to create the database in PostgreSQL and import the data.\nExercise\nExercise 6 Create a PostgreSQL database with the tables that you defined in the previous exercise. Import the data into the tables.\nRunning queries Write the following queries in SQL.\nExercise\nExercise 7 Get the average ticket price on Air France flights.\nCount the number of customers by country.\nSelect the names of the airports in Paris, France.\nSelect the name of the cities (city and country name) with the most airports.\nSelect the name of the airline companies that use an Airbus A300.\nSelect the identifier, first and family names of all customers who flew to Sydney, Australia.\nSelect the identifier, name, city and country of the busiest airport (the one with more outbound and inbound flights).\nSelect the average price in the economy class.\nSelect the average price in the business class.\nSelect the name, city and country of the destination airport of french customers.\nSelect the destination cities (specify city and country name) preferred by women.\nSelect the destination cities (specify city and country name) preferred by men.\nCount the number of customers by country flying to Paris.\nCount the number of hotels by city.\nDetermine the amount of money spent by Tatiana REZE in flights.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"85d2d631269d7307bfde5c4b0669c155","permalink":"/courses/databases/exam/project/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/databases/exam/project/","section":"courses","summary":"Project","tags":null,"title":"Description","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Run containers Docker command: docker run [options] image-name [command] [arg]\nExample: Running a container from the image alpine.\ndocker run image-name docker run image-name command docker run image-name command arg docker run alpine docker run alpine ls docker run alpine ping 192.168.3.1 Common options:\nRemove the container when it exits Give the container a name Allocate a terminal for the container docker run --rm alpine docker run --name toto alpine docker run -it alpine Mount data-volume at /data** Container port –\u0026gt; random host port Host port 8080 –\u0026gt; container port 80 docker run -v data-volume:/data alpine docker run --P alpine docker run -p 8080:80 alpine Attach container to network docker run --network mynet alpine Manage containers List all containers List running containers Stop a container docker container ls -a docker container ls docker stop my-container Remove a container Remove all stopped containers Start a container docker container rm my-container docker container prune docker start my-container Start a container (I/O) Inspect changes in a container Create image from container docker start -ai my-container docker diff my-container docker commit my-container new-image Build images Docker command: docker build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL\nExample.

Hence, the idea of setting up a data warehouse.\nIn order to model a schema for the Sakila data warehouse, we need to identify dimensions and facts. To this extent, we first identify the business questions that the Sakila management wants to be answered.\nExercise\nExercise 1 List some of the business questions that the Sakila management would like to answer.\nSolution\nDifferent sets of questions are possible. Here are some examples.\nWhich store generates the most revenue? Which customers have rented the most in the past year? (maybe to award fidelity points). Which customers have rented the least in the past year? (maybe to offer some discounts to encourage the customer to rent again). Which staffer has processed the most of the rentals in the past year? (staffer of the year). Which staffer has processed the least of the rentals in the past year? (maybe a layoff in sight?). Which month has the highest revenue? By country, by store? Which country generates the least revenue? (is there any concurrent out there that might be soon a threat in other countries too?) Which categories of films are most popular? We recall here the conceptual model of the Sakila database.\nFigure 1: The conceptual schema of the Sakila database Exercise\nExercise 2 Based on the business questions identified in the first exercise, can you tell what the fact and the dimension tables are?\nRecall that the fact table should contain measures and the dimension tables should contain the context of the facts. The dimension table should answer the following questions about a fact: who, what, when, where.\nSolution\nFrom the questions that we identified in the previous exercise, it is clear that we intend to use the data warehouse to answer questions about the rentals.\nTherefore, our fact table will be fact_rental.\nAs for the dimensions:\nQuestion 1. suggests the use of the dimension store (where).\nQuestions 2., 3. suggest the use of the dimension customer (who).\nQuestions 4., 5. suggest the use of the dimension staff (who).\nQuestion 8. suggests the use of the dimension film (what).\nAll questions suggests the use of a time dimension (when).\nThe time dimension is virtually always present in a data warehouse.\nDimensional modeling Now that we identified the fact and the dimension tables, we incrementally draw the star diagram for the Sakila data warehouse.\nExercise\nExercise 3 Draw a first sketch of the star diagram. Do not specify any attributes in the tables. Solution\nExercise\nExercise 4 Identify the primary key of the fact table.\nSolution\nThe primary key of the fact table is composed of all the attributes that refer to the dimensions. So, we write an attribute for each dimension:\nstaff_pk, foreign key to the dimension dim_staff.\nfilm_pk, foreign key to the dimension dim_film.\nperiod_pk, foreign key to the dimension dim_period.\nstore_pk, foreign key to the dimension dim_store.\ncustomer_pk, foreign key to the dimension dim_customer.\nHere is the new schema.\nExercise\nExercise 5 For each dimension table, there is a corresponding table in the operational database.\nDiscuss which attributes you would add to the dimension tables.\nIn particular, consider the following points:\nAre you going to add to a dimension table the\nprimary key of the corresponding operational table?\nAre you going to add to a dimension table attributes that are not part of the corresponding table?\nSolution\nEach dimension table already has a primary key. However, this is the surrogate key that identifies each entity in the dimension table. The business key that is in the corresponding operational table is still a valuable attribute to add. So, for example, in the table dim_film we’ll add the attribute film_id that is the primary key in the operational table film.\nIn each dimension table, we typically add all the attributes that are in the corresponding operational table. However, we also add attributes that are in the linked tables, if they’re necessary to our analysis. For example, in the operational database the category of a film is\nin a separate table film_category (as a result of the normalization process). If we decide to integrate these dimensions and keep a normalized schema, we obtain a snowflake schema.\nHowever, in a data warehouse we tend to denormalize the dimension tables, to avoid to incur the cost of joining tables.\nOne last remark on the attribute film_categories in table dim_film. The value of this attribute is a list. One might want to avoid this by using a one-hot encoding. In other words, if the set of all possible categories is small, we can have one boolean attribute for each category; a True value would indicate that the film is in the corresponding category.\nExercise\nExercise 6 In our schema, the fact table is factless: it only contains a primary key with no measurements.\nWhich measurements would you introduce?\nSolution\nIt all depends on the queries that we intend to ask. In the queries that we identified at the beginning of the tutorial, we were interested in the revenue generated by the rentals. Also, we might want to keep track of the number of rentals of a given film by a given customer in the given period, and the number of returns.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e0f51988875bad75f93f80cf12979fe4","permalink":"/courses/gadexed/tutorials/data-warehouse/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/gadexed/tutorials/data-warehouse/","section":"courses","summary":"Data modeling for data warehousing","tags":null,"title":"Data warehousing","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Use case scenario The Sakila database is serving an increasing number of queries from staff and customers around the world. A single monolithic database is not sufficient anymore to serve all the requests and the company is thinking of distributing the database across several servers (horizontal scalability). However, a relational database does not handle horizontal scalability very well, due to the fact that the data is scattered across numerous tables, as are result of the normalization process. Hence, the Sakila team is turning to you to help them migrate the database from PostgreSQL to MongoDB.\nFor the migration to happen, it is necessary to conceive a suitable data model. From the first discussions with the Sakila management, you quickly understand that one of the main use of the database is to manage (add, update and read) rental information.\nAnalysis of the existing model The existing data model is recalled in the following figure.\nFigure 1: The conceptual schema of the Sakila database Exercise\nExercise 1 Determine the cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) of each of the relationships in which the entity Rental is involved.\nN.B. Don’t hesitate to look at the attributes of each entity in the existing PostgreSQL database.\nSolution\nThe entity Rental has a relationship with the following tables;\nInventory. A rental refers to a single inventory (essentially, a copy of a DVD). An inventory might be part of several rentals. This is a one-to-many relationship.\nStaff. A rental is taken care of by a single staff member, A staff member might take care of several rentals. This is a one-to-many relationship.\nCustomer. A rental is made by a single customer. A customer might make several rentals. This is a one-to-many relationship.\nPayment. A payment is relative to a single rental. A rental is associated with a single payment. This is a one-to-one relationship.\nExercise\nExercise 2 Look at the tables Rental and Customer in the PostgreSQL Sakila database.\nEstimate the size of a row in bytes in both tables.\nThe following considerations will help you in the task.\nThe storage size of a numeric data type is clearly indicated in the PostgreSQL documentation.\nThe storage size of date/time types is clearly indicated in the PostgreSQL documentation\nThe columns with type text hold UTF-8 characters. We assume that each character is 1 byte long (although some characters might need more than 1 byte).\nThe columns with type boolean needs 1 byte storage.\nWe assume that an email address is 25 characters long on average.\nWe assume that a last name is 7 characters long on average.\nWe assume that a first name is 6 characters long on average.\nIn both tables we ignore the columns last_update and create_date.\nIn table Customer we ignore the column active. Solution\nFor the table Rental we have:\nColumn rental_id, integer, 4 bytes.\nColumn rental_date, timestamp with time zone, 8 bytes.\nColumn inventory_id, integer, 4 bytes.\nColumn customer_id, smallint, 2 bytes.\nColumn return_date, timestamp with time zone, 8 bytes.\nColumn staff_id, smallint, 2 bytes.\nIn total, a row in table Rental needs 28 bytes of storage.\nFor the table Customer we have:\nColumn customer_id, integer, 4 bytes.\nColumn store_id, smallint, 2 bytes.\nColumn first_name, text, 6 bytes (average).\nColumn last_name, text, 7 bytes (average).\nColumn email, text, 25 bytes (average).\nColumn address_id, smallint, 2 bytes.\nColumn activebool, boolean, 1 byte.\nIn total, a row in table Customer needs 47 bytes of storage.\nConsiderations for the new model We need to take some decisions as to the new data model. The considerations that we made in the previous exercises will lead us to the right decisions.\nExercise\nExercise 3 How would you model in MongoDB the entities Rental and Payment, given the cardinalities that you identified in the previous section?\nSolution\nThe relationship between the two given entities is one-to-one. Therefore, we can use a denormalized schema in MongoDB.\nThat is, we can create one single collection to store the information about the two entities.\nWe have two options:\nWe create a collection Payment, where each document contains the attributes of a payment and an embedded document with the details of the rental the payment refers to.\nWe create a collection Rental, where each document contains the attributes of a rental and an embedded document with the details of the payment for the rental.\nAlthough both options are perfectly valid, we prefer the second one, as rentals are our first-class citizens in our database.\nWe can also consider the attributes of a payment as attributes of a rental, without creating an embedded document for the payment.\nExercise\nExercise 4 Suppose that we create a collection Customer and we embed in each customer document the list of rentals for that customer.\nHow many rentals can we store at most for a given customer, knowing that the size of a document cannot exceed 16 MB?\nSolution\nWe’ve seen before that each rental needs 28 bytes of space. To make the computation easier, we round this size up to 32 bytes (a power of two). Considering that 16 MB = \\(16 \\times 2^{20}\\), the maximum number of rentals that we can store for a given customer is given by:\n\\[ \\frac{16 \\times 2^{20}}{32} = 2^{-1} \\times 2^{20} = 2^{19} \\]\nThis gives around 600,000 rentals.\nExercise\nExercise 5 In our current database we have:\n599 customers.\n16044 rentals.\nOn average, each customer has around 27 rentals.\nCompute the size in byte of the two following collections:\nCollection Customer, where each document contains the information about a customer and an embedded list with the information on all the rentals made by the customer.\nCollection Rental, where each document contains the information about a rental and an embedded document with the information on the customer that made the rental. Solution\nWe previously found out that for each customer we need 47 bytes and for each rental we need 28 bytes.\nA document that holds the data about a customer and the list of all the rentals of the customer will need \\(47 + 27 \\times 28 = 830\\) bytes.\nHence, the total size of the Customer collection is \\(803 \\times 599 = 480977\\) bytes, that is 470 KB.\nA document that holds the data about a rental and its customer needs $ 28 + 47 = 75 $ bytes.\nHence, the total size of the Rental collection is \\(75 \\times 16044 = 1203300\\) bytes, that is 1,1 MB.\nExercise\nExercise 6 Discuss advantages and disadvantages of the two following options:\nA collection Customer with a document for each customer holding the list of all the rentals of the customer.\nA collection Rental with a document for each rental holding the data on the relative customer. Solution\nAdvantages of solution 1.:\nThere is no redundancy. In fact, a rental is relative to at most one customer, therefore the data on a rental is not duplicated across different documents.\nAs a result, the size of the collection is smaller than the collection in solution 2.\nFor each customer, we retrieve the information on all his/her rentals with only one read operation\nDisadvantages of solution 1.:\nThere is a limit (albeit an acceptable one) on the number of rentals that we can store for each customer.\nWe lose a “rental-centric” view of our data. As a result, if any other document in another collection (e.g., staff) refers to a rental, all the information about a rental must be denormalized in that document.\nAdvantages of solution 2.\nA “rental-centric” view of our data. Aggregating information from different rentals does not require digging rentals out of several lists.\nThe size of each document is small and will never exceed the 16 MB limit.\nAs a result, reading a document from the collection takes less time and memory than reading a document from the collection in solution 1.\nDisadvantages of solution 2.\nThere is a lot of redundancy. The information about a customer are replicated each time the customer makes a rental.\nAs a result, the size of the collection is much higher than in solution 1.\nIt seems that one of the two solutions has a higher storage demands than the other, and therefore the odds seems to be stacked against that solution.\nHowever….\nWe still have to consider two more entities that are linked to the rentals: staff and inventory.\nExercise\nExercise 7 Discuss how you can fit staff and inventory in each of the solutions presented in the previous exercise. Discuss advantages and disadvantages of each option that you present.\nSolution\nSolution 1\nWe need to somehow link staff and inventory to the relative rental. We have three options:\nWe embed staff and inventory into each rental document, which, let’s recall it, is already embedded in an array. This creates redundancy, as a staff member or an inventory item can appear in more than one rental.\nWe create three separate collections (Customer, Staff and Inventory) and in each we embed an array with the list of the relative rentals. The problem is that the data on the rentals are now replicated three times. This solution is particularly bad, because rentals are frequently written. When we create a rental, we need to write three documents; when a customer returns an item, we need to update the return date in three documents.\nWe create four collections (Customer, Staff, Inventory and Rentals); for each customer, staff and inventory we keep a list of rentals, each item being the identifier that refers to the appropriate rental. We fall back to the normalized schema of the PostgreSQL database. Then, it isn’t clear how this normalized schema will help horizontally scale the database.\nSolution 2\nWe have only one collection Rental; in each document, we have an attribute customer, whose value is an embedded document with all the information about a customer, an attribute staff, whose value is an embedded document with all information about a staff member, and an attribute inventory, whose value is an embedded document with all information about an inventory item.\nThis solution has higher storage requirements than the options presented in solution 1, but it has the clear advantage of being a denormalized schema, where we control every facet of a rental (customer, staff, inventory). Moreover, when we create a rental, we only write one document ; when we update the return date of a rental, we only update one document.\nFrom the previous exercise, we have a clearer idea as to the best solution to our case. We take a closer look at the storage requirements of the adopted solution. Consider that:\nThe size in byte of a document storing the information of a staff member is around 84000 bytes (we also store a profile picture).\nThe size in byte of a document storing the information of an inventory item is 16 bytes.\nExercise\nExercise 8 If we denote by \\(N_{rental}\\) the number of rentals, what is the size in bytes of the whole database for the adopted solution?\nSolution\nLet’s recall that the size in bytes of a document storing the information on a customer is 47 bytes.\nThe size of the only collection Rental (hence, of the whole database) is:\n\\[ N_{rentals} \\times (47 + 84000 + 16) = N_{rentals} \\times 84063 \\]\nWith 10,000 rentals, the size of the database is 800 MB. With 100,000 rentals, the size of the database is 7 GB. With 1,000,000 rentals, the size of the database is 78 GB.\nAlthough the size that we determined in the previous exercise, may not sound impressive, we still have to store other information (films, actors….). If we could save a bit of space, we would be happy.\nExercise\nExercise 9 Discuss how you could save some space in the adopted solution.\nHINT. Do you really need to denormalize all data?\nSolution\nWhile modeling data for a MongoDB database, the choice between a normalized and a denormalized schema does not need to be a black and white one.\nWe can have a denormalized schema, where we embed in the same documents information that are queried together, while storing in a separate collection the information that are rarely queried.\nFor instance, the profile picture of a staff member might not be an important piece of information while we’re trying to analyze which staff members are the more productive ones.\nSo, we might add another collection Staff where each document only contains attributes that are not in embedded documents in the collection Rental.\nExercise\nExercise 10 Propose a solution for all the entities involved and estimate the saving in terms of storage requirements.\nSolution\nHere is a solution with three different collections. The information on inventory are completely denormalized into the collection Rental. For customers and staff members we only keep the necessary information and we normalize the information that are less likely to be queried while analyzing the rentals.\nLet’s try to estimate the savings in terms of storage. In a document of the collection Rental, we have the following attributes:\nrental_id: 4 bytes.\nrental_date and return_date: 16 bytes.\ninventory_id: 4 bytes\nfilm_id and store_id: 4 bytes\ncustomer_id: 4 bytes\ncustomer first and last names: 13 bytes.\ncountry: 9 bytes (on average a country name has 9 characters).\nstaff_id: 4 bytes\nstaff first and last name: 13 bytes.\nIn total a document in our collection Rental will have 71 bytes (a huge improvement wrt the 84000 bytes of our first solution).\nOf course, the size of a document in the Staff collection will be around 84000 bytes (we still store the profile picture). However, the number of staff members \\(N_{staff}\\) is much lower than the number of rentals \\(N_{rentals}\\).\nIt is easy to verify that the size of a document of the collection Customer is 34 bytes (same information as before except first and last name). Again, the number of customers \\(N_{customers}\\) is much lower than \\(N_{rentals}\\).\nWe assume that each customer has on average 30 rentals and for 100 customers we have 1 staff member. We have that:\n$N_{customer} = N_{rental}/30 $\n$N_{staff} = N_{customer}/100 = N_{rental}/3000 $\nSo, the size of the database will be given by:\n\\[ 71\\times N_{rentals} + 84000 \\times N_{rentals}/3000 + 34 \\times N_{rentals}/30 = 100 \\times N_{rental} \\]\nIf we want to compare against the first solution:\nWith 10,000 rentals, the size of the database is 976 KB (instead of 800 MB). With 100,000 rentals, the size of the database is 9,5 MB (instead of 7 GB). With 1,000,000 rentals, the size of the database is 95 MB (instead of 78 GB). As you can see, a big improvement! And we have a denormalized schema that lets us take advantage of the horizontal scalability of MongoDB.\nThe new model In this section we intend to obtain a complete model of the Sakila database.\nExercise\nExercise 11 Consider the model that we obtained at the end of the previous section. Which data can you further denormalize?\nSolution\nCollection Staff\nThe attribute address_id refers to a full address. We can fully denormalize this information into the documents of the collection.\nThe attribute store_id refers to the store where the staff member works. The Store table in the original PostgreSQL database does not have too many columns. Therefore, it might be reasonable to fully denormalize these data. However, information on the stores are also linked to customers and to inventory items. If we need to update, say, the manager of a store, we would need to update three different documents. Hence, we prefer to create a collection Store and keep in the documents of the collection Staff only the city and country of a store (and its identifier of course).\nAttribute Inventory in collection Customer\nSame considerations for the attribute store_id.\nThe attribute film_id is the reference to the film the inventory item is relative to. The table Film in the original PostgreSQL database contains 14 columns. This high number of attributes advises us against a full denormalization, considering that a film can be relative to multiple inventory items. We might only keep the film title and the film categories. The rest of the attributes are kept in documents of a separate collection Film.\nCollection Customer\nSame considerations for the attributes store_id and address_id.\nExercise\nExercise 12 Complete the diagram obtained in the previous exercise so as to obtain a full data model for the Sakila database.\nSolution\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"04a283ce7d4305dbfa85000556910018","permalink":"/courses/gadexed/tutorials/mongodb-data-modeling/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/gadexed/tutorials/mongodb-data-modeling/","section":"courses","summary":"Data modeling in MongoDB","tags":null,"title":"Data modeling in MongoDB","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial you’ll learn to write basic and advanced queries in MongoDB.\nGet the data Download the this archive file and extract it.

We are now going to see an example to obtain the titles of the movies that have been rated by at least 100 users.\nAt a first glance, the following query looks like a good solution:\nMATCH (n:Movie)\u003c-[:RATED]-(u:User) WHERE count(u) \u003e= 100 RETURN n.title_en LIMIT 5; However, executing this query returns the following error:\nInvalid use of aggregating function count(...) in this context (line 1, column 42 (offset: 41)) \"MATCH (n:Movie)\u003c-[:RATED]-(u:User) WHERE count(u) \u003e= 100\" Similarly to SQL, we cannot use aggregating functions in the clause WHERE.\nA correct formulation of the query requires the use of the clause WITH to concatenate two queries: the first will count the number of rates for each movie:\nMATCH (n:Movie)\u003c-[:RATED]-(u:User) RETURN n, count(u) as nb_rates The second will take in the output of the first and will filter all the movies where nb_rates \u0026lt; 100. In order to chain the two queries, we’ll replace the RETURN clause in the first query with a WITH clause, as follows:\nMATCH (n:Movie)\u003c-[:RATED]-(u:User) WITH n, count(u) as nb_rates WHERE nb_rates \u003e= 100 RETURN n.title_en Exercise Exercise 4 Write and execute a query to obtain the five movies that obtained the best average rate among the movies that have been rated by at least 100 users.\nSolution\nMATCH (n:Movie)\u003c-[r:RATED]-(u:User) WITH n, avg(r.rate) as avg, count(u) AS nb_rates WHERE nb_rates \u003e= 100 RETURN n.title_en, avg ORDER BY avg DESC; Movie recommendation We are now going to see how Neo4j can be effectively used in a real application by implementing queries that form the basis of a simple movie recommendation system. This system is based on the notion of collaborative filtering.\nThis consists in recommending a user \\(u\\) some films that s/he hasn’t rated yet and other users with similar preferences have loved. In our context, we say that a user loves a movie if s/he rated the movie at least 3.\nThis concept is explained in the following figure.\nThe user \\(u\\) loves 6 movies, 3 of which are also loved by the user \\(v\\) (the black nodes); it is reasonable to think that \\(u\\) may also love the two movies that \\(v\\) loved and \\(u\\) hasn’t rated yet.\nThe principle of collaborative filtering is based on the computation of a similarity score between two users. Several similarity scores are possible in this context; here, we are going to use the Jaccard coefficient. Let \\(L(u)\\) and \\(L(v)\\) be the sets of movies that \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) love respectively; the similarity score \\(J(u,v)\\) between \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) is given by:\n\\[ J(u, v) = \\frac{|L(u) \\cap L(v)|}{|L(u) \\cup L(v)|} \\]\nIn order to recommend movies to a target user \\(v\\), the recommender system computes the similarity score between \\(v\\) and all the other users of the system and proposes to \\(v\\) the movies that s/he hasn’t rated yet and that the \\(k\\) most similar users loved.\nWe are now going to incrementally write a query to recommend some movies to the target user 3. The first step consists in determining the value \\(|L(v)|\\).\nExercise Exercise 5 Write and execute the query to obtain the number of movies that the user 3 loved. This query must return the target user and the number of movies that s/he loves.\nSolution\nMATCH (target:User {user_id:3})-[r:RATED]-\u003e(m:Movie) WHERE r.rate \u003e= 3 RETURN target, count(m) AS lovedByTarget; Next, we are going to determine the value \\(|L(u)|\\), for all users \\(u\\) except \\(v\\).\nExercise Exercise 6 Write and execute the query to obtain the number of movies that each user \\(u\\) loves, except the target user 3. This query must return each user \\(u\\) and the number of movies that s/he loves.\nSolution\nMATCH (other:User)-[r:RATED]-\u003e(m:Movie) WHERE other.user_id \u003c\u003e 3 and r.rate \u003e= 3 RETURN other, count(m) as lovedByOther We put the two queries together with the clause WITH.\nExercise Exercise 7 Compose the two previous queries with the clause WITH. This query must return the target user 3, the number of movies that s/he loves, the other users \\(u\\) and the number of movies that they love.\nSolution\nMATCH (target:User {user_id:3})-[r:RATED]-\u003e(m:Movie) WHERE r.rate \u003e= 3 WITH target, count(m) AS lovedByTarget MATCH (other:User)-[r:RATED]-\u003e(m:Movie) WHERE other \u003c\u003e target and r.rate \u003e= 3 RETURN target, lovedByTarget, other, count(m) as lovedByOther Now, we need to determine the value \\(L(u)\\cup L(v)\\), for each user \\(u\\), and compute the similarity score with the Jaccard coefficient.\nExercise Exercise 8 Append (by using WITH) to the query written in the previous exercise a query that obtains the number of movies that any user \\(u\\) loved and that the target user 3 loved too, and computes the similarity score between the target user 3 and \\(u\\). This query must return the five most similar users to the target user and the similarity scores.\nHint Multiply the numerator of the equation by 1.0, otherwise Cypher will compute an integer division. Solution\nThe following is the query written at the previous exercise, where the RETURN clause has been replaced with WITH.\nMATCH (target:User {user_id:3})-[r:RATED]-\u003e(m:Movie) WHERE r.rate \u003e= 3 WITH target, count(m) AS lovedByTarget MATCH (other:User)-[r:RATED]-\u003e(m:Movie) WHERE other \u003c\u003e target and r.rate \u003e= 3 WITH target, lovedByTarget, other, count(m) as lovedByOther We have to append the following query:\nMATCH (target)-[r:RATED]-\u003e(m:Movie)\u003c-[r1:RATED]-(other) WHERE r.rate \u003e= 3 and r1.rate \u003e= 3 RETURN other, count(m)*1.0 / (lovedByTarget + lovedByOther - count(m)) as sim ORDER BY sim DESC LIMIT 5 The last step consists in recommending some movies to the target user. From the previous query, take the identifier of the user \\(w\\) with the highest similarity to the target user. You are going to use this identifier directly in the new query.\nExercise Exercise 9 Write and execute the query to obtain the list of the movies that the user \\(w\\) loved and that the target user hasn’t rated yet. Sort this list by decreasing rate.\nHint\nFirst, write a query to obtain the list of the movies that the target user rated. In the MATCH clause, use the variable \\(m\\) to indicate a movie that the target user rated. Conclude the query with: RETURN collect(m.title_en) AS movies The function collect creates a list called movies.\nReplace RETURN with WITH in the previous query and add a second query to select the titles of the movies \\(m\\) that the user \\(w\\) loved and the target user did not rate. In order to exclude the films that the target user did not rate, use the following predicate: none(x in movies where x=m.title_en) in the WHERE clause.\nSolution\nThe following is the query written at the previous exercise, where the RETURN clause has been replaced with WITH.\nMATCH (target:User {user_id:3})-[r:RATED]-\u003e(m:Movie) WITH collect(m.title_en) as movies MATCH (u:User {user_id:129})-[r:RATED]-\u003e(m:Movie) WHERE r.rate \u003e=3 AND none(x IN movies WHERE x=m.title_en) RETURN m.title_en ORDER BY r.rate DESC; ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6366e58486d6b6b25b071d1accc8c5c6","permalink":"/courses/gadexed/tutorials/neo4j/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/gadexed/tutorials/neo4j/","section":"courses","summary":"Queries in Neo4j","tags":null,"title":"Neo4j","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial you’ll learn:\nHow to obtain a non-redundant set of functional dependencies. How to determine the candidate keys of a table given its functional dependencies. How to determine the normal form of a table. Question 1 We consider a relational table \\(R\\) with four columns \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\) and \\(D\\). Let \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) be the following set of functional dependencies:\n\\(AB \\rightarrow C\\)\n\\(D \\rightarrow BC\\)\n\\(A \\rightarrow B\\)\nExercise\nExercise 1 Derive a minimal set \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) of functional dependencies that is equivalent to \\(\\mathcal{F}\\).\nSolution\nWe first need to write the functional dependencies in canonical form (the right-side of each FD must consist of only one column).\nThe FD (2.) can be rewritten using the decomposition axiom.\n\\(AB \\rightarrow C\\)\n\\(D \\rightarrow B\\)\n\\(D \\rightarrow C\\)\n\\(A \\rightarrow B\\)\nNext, we need to make sure that all functional dependencies are left-irreducible.\nAll functional dependencies except the first one is trivially left-irreducible (the determinant consists of only one column). The first has two columns in the determinant, therefore we need to check whether we can eliminate one of the two columns and still preserve an equivalent set of functional dependencies.\nWe apply Armstrong’s axioms to compute the closure of this set of functional dependencies.\nFrom (1.) and (4.), we can apply the pseudotransitivity axiom and we obtain:\n\\[A \\rightarrow B \\wedge AB \\rightarrow C \\implies AA \\rightarrow C \\implies A \\rightarrow C\\]\nSince \\(A \\rightarrow C\\) is in the cover, the column \\(B\\) in FD (1.) is useless and can therefore be omitted.\nThe set \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) consists of the following FDs:\n\\(A \\rightarrow C\\)\n\\(D \\rightarrow B\\)\n\\(D \\rightarrow C\\)\n\\(A \\rightarrow B\\)\nNone of these functional dependencies are redundant.\nQuestion 2 Let \\(R\\) be a relational table with five columns \\((A, B, C, D, E)\\). The following set \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) of functional dependencies hold:\n\\(AB \\rightarrow C\\) \\(C \\rightarrow A\\) \\(C \\rightarrow B\\) \\(C \\rightarrow D\\) \\(D \\rightarrow E\\) Exercise\nExercise 2 Specify the candidate keys of the table \\(R\\).\nSolution\nA candidate key is a set of columns that imply all the other columns.\nFirst, let’s try sets composed of only one column: \\(\\{A\\}\\), \\(\\{B\\}\\), \\(\\{C\\}\\), \\(\\{D\\}\\) and \\(\\{E\\}\\).\nWe have the following: (\\(\\{X\\}^+_{\\mathcal{F}}\\) indicates the set of all columns implied by \\(X\\)).\n\\(\\{A\\}^+_{\\mathcal{F}} = \\{A\\}\\)\n\\(\\{B\\}^+_{\\mathcal{F}} = \\{B\\}\\)\n\\(\\{C\\}^+_{\\mathcal{F}} = \\{A, B, C, D, E\\}\\)\n\\(\\{D\\}^+_{\\mathcal{F}} = \\{D, E\\}\\)\n\\(\\{E\\}^+_{\\mathcal{F}} = \\{E\\}\\)\nTherefore, \\(\\{C\\}\\) is a candidate key because it implies all the other columns.\nFrom the functional dependency (1), we obtain that \\(AB\\) implies \\(C\\); therefore, by transitivity they imply all the other columns.\nIn conclusion, we have two candidate keys: \\(\\{C\\}\\) and \\(\\{A, B\\}\\).\nExercise\nExercise 3 We assume that \\(R\\) is in 1NF.\nIs table \\(R\\) in 2NF? Justify your answer.\nIs table \\(R\\) in 3NF? Justify your answer.\nIs table \\(R\\) in BCNF? Justify your answer. Solution\n\\(R\\) is in 2NF. In fact, all non-prime columns depend entirely on both candidate keys.\n\\(R\\) is not in 3NF. In fact, the functional dependency \\(D \\rightarrow E\\) is between two non-prime columns.\nAs a result, \\(R\\) is not in BCNF either.\nExercise\nExercise 4 If the table \\(R\\) from the previous exercise is not in BCNF, how would you change the schema so that BCNF is satisfied? For each table, specify the primary key and the foreign keys linking the tables to each other.\nSolution\nThe table is not in 3NF. The offending functional dependency is \\(D \\rightarrow E\\).\nWe need to create a new table \\(R_1\\), where the primary key is the determinant in the offending functional dependency (\\(D\\)). We then move all columns that are dependent on \\(D\\) (only \\(E\\) in our case) from \\(R\\) to \\(R_1\\). Note that \\(D\\) is kept in \\(R\\) so that we can use it to link \\(R\\) with \\(R_1\\).\nIn summary:\n\\[R = \\{A, B, C, D\\}\\]\n\\[R_1 = \\{D, E\\}\\]\nThe primary key of \\(R\\) is \\(\\{C\\}\\) (or, we can also choose \\(\\{A, B\\}\\) if we want). The primary key of \\(R_1\\) is \\(\\{D\\}\\).\nThe column \\(D\\) in \\(R\\) is a foreign key referencing the column \\(D\\) in \\(R_1\\).\nQuestion 3 Let \\(R\\) be a relational table with four columns \\((A, B, C, D)\\). \\(\\{A, B\\}\\) is the only candidate key.\nExercise\nExercise 5 Identify a minimal set of functional dependencies. Justify your answer.\nSolution\nA candidate key implies all the other columns of the table. Therefore we have :\n\\[AB \\rightarrow C\\] \\[AB \\rightarrow D\\]\nBoth functional dependencies are in canonical form (the right side only consist of one column). Trivially, both functional dependencies are left-irreducible (we cannot remove any of the columns in the determinant without losing information). So, this is a minimal set of functional dependencies.\nExercise\nExercise 6 Add \\(B \\rightarrow D\\) to the set of functional dependencies that you identified in the previous exercise. Modify the minimal set of functional dependencies accordingly. Justify your answer.\nSolution\nWe consider the following functional dependencies:\n\\(AB \\rightarrow C\\) \\(AB \\rightarrow D\\) \\(B \\rightarrow D\\) The FD (3) clearly makes FD (2) redundant. By using the augmentation axiom on (3) we obtain:\n\\(AB \\rightarrow AD\\) By applying the decomposition axiom on (4) we obtain:\n\\(AB \\rightarrow A\\)\n\\(AB \\rightarrow D\\)\nWhich shows that (2) is redundant.\nIn summary, we have the following functional dependencies:\n\\[AB\\rightarrow C \\] \\[B\\rightarrow D \\]\nExercise\nExercise 7 We assume that \\(R\\) is in 1NF.\nIs table \\(R\\) in 2NF? Justify your answer.\nIs table \\(R\\) in 3NF? Justify your answer.\nIs table \\(R\\) in BCNF? Justify your answer. Solution\n\\(R\\) is not in 2NF. In fact, the non-prime column \\(C\\) is functionally dependent on only one part of the candidate key.\n\\(R\\) is not in 3NF, let alone BCNF, because it doesn’t fulfill the first condition, that is being in 2NF.\nExercise\nExercise 8 Normalize \\(R\\) to the BCNF form. Justify your choices.\nSolution\nThe functional dependency that gives a partial dependency is: \\(B \\rightarrow D\\). We create a new table \\(R_1\\), where the determinant (\\(B\\)) of the offending functional dependency is the primary key. We move the columns that depend on \\(B\\) (here, only \\(D\\)) from table \\(R\\) to table \\(R_1\\).\nIn summary:\n\\[R = (A, B, C)\\]\n\\[R_1 = (B, D)\\]\nWe can see that \\(R\\) is in 3NF because:\nThe only non-prime column is \\(C\\), therefore there cannot be any dependency between non-prime columns. \\(R\\) is in BCNF because:\nThe only functional dependency \\(AB \\rightarrow C\\) has a key as its determinant. Similarly, for \\(R_1\\).\nQuestion 4 We consider the following table:\nPatient (ssn, first_name, last_name, phone_number, insurance_number, insurance_expiration_date) where the following set \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) of functional dependencies holds:\nssn -\u0026gt; first_name, last_name, phone_number, insurance_number, insurance_expiration_date insurance_number -\u0026gt; insurance_expiration_date Exercise\nExercise 9 Derive a minimal set \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) of functional dependencies that is equivalent to \\(\\mathcal{F}\\). Solution\nFirst, we need to rewrite the FDs in canonical form.\n\\(ssn \\rightarrow first\\_name\\) \\(ssn \\rightarrow last\\_name\\) \\(ssn \\rightarrow phone\\_number\\) \\(ssn \\rightarrow insurance\\_number\\) \\(ssn \\rightarrow insurance\\_expiration\\_date\\) \\(insurance\\_number \\rightarrow insurance\\_expiration\\_date\\) The determinant of each FD is composed of only one column, therefore it is already left-irreducible. It is easy to see that all FDs with ssn as a determinant must be kept (otherwise we lose some information).\nBy transitivity from 4. and 6. we obtain:\n\\[ssn \\rightarrow insurance\\_expiration\\_date\\]\nTherefore, \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) is obtained from \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) by removing 5.\nExercise\nExercise 10 Given \\(\\mathcal{G}\\), identify the candidate keys in the table Patient. Solution\nFrom the functional dependencies in \\(\\mathcal{F}\\), it’s easy to see that that the only column that implies all the others is ssn. Therefore, {ssn} is the only candidate key in this table.\nExercise\nExercise 11 Specify the normal form of the table Patient. Justify your answer. Solution\nIt is immediate to verify that the table is 1NF.\nThe table is 2NF because there is only one candidate key, which is composed of only one column. Therefore, there cannot be any partial dependency.\nThe table is not in 3NF. Indeed, there is a functional dependency between two non-prime columns:\n\\[insurance\\_number \\rightarrow insurance\\_expiration\\_date\\]\nExercise\nExercise 12 How would you normalize table Patient to BCNF? Justify your answer. Solution\nThe offending functional dependency is:\n\\[insurance\\_number \\rightarrow insurance\\_expiration\\_date\\]\nWe need to create another table (let’s call it Insurance) that contains the determinant of the offending functional dependency (insurance_number) as its primary key. We need to move the colum (insurance_expiration_date) that depends on insurance_number from table Patient to table Insurance.\nIn summary:\nPatient (ssn, first_name, last_name, phone_number, insurance_number) Insurance (insurance_number, insurance_expiration_date) Note that the column insurance_number in table Patient is foreign key to the column insurance_number in table Insurance.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"35fe9e284966e1fb96db406a664544bb","permalink":"/courses/gadexed/tutorials/normalization/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/gadexed/tutorials/normalization/","section":"courses","summary":"Normalization theory exercises","tags":null,"title":"Normalization theory","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial you’ll learn:\nHow to create a conceptual schema of a database.

How to translate a conceptual model into a logical model. 1 Database of a social network platform A social network platform wants to design a relational database to store information on its users. For each user, the platform keeps its nickname, that uniquely identifies the user in the platform, first and family name, geographic location (city and country) and email address; the user can register as many email addresses as s/he wishes. Any user can share content on the platform; each post is characterized by its content, date, time and, when available, the geolocation (latitude, longitude). Optionally, users can tag one or more friends in their posts.\nTwo users are linked by a friendship relationship if both agree on befriending each other; a user can also follow another user without necessarily befriending her. For any type of relationship (friendship or follower), the platform registers the date when the relationship is established.\n1.1 Exercises Exercise\nExercise 1.1 Give the conceptual schema of the database with an ER diagram.\nSolution\nExercise\nExercise 1.2 Translate the conceptual schema into a logical schema. For each table, underline the primary key and specify the foreign keys.\nSolution\nThe collection of tables is the following:\nUserAccount (nickname, first_name, last_name, city, country) Post (post_id, content, date, time, lat, long, nickname) EmailAddress (email_address, nickname) Relationship (nickname_src, nickname_dst, type, date) Tag (post_id, nickname) The foreign keys are the following:\nPost(nickname) → UserAccount(nickname).\nEmailAddress(nickname) → EmailAddress(nickname).\nRelationship(nickname_src) → UserAccount(nickname).\nRelationship(nickname_dst) → UserAccount(nickname).\nTag(post_id) → Post(post_id).\nTag(nickname) → UserAccount(nickname).\n2 Database of a banking system The following figure shows the ER diagram with the conceptual schema of a banking system database.\nFigure 2.1: The conceptual schema of the bank database Each bank is identified by a unique code and name, and has one or several branches. A branch is responsible for opening accounts and granting loans to customers. Each account is identified by a number (acct_nbr) and is either a checking or savings account (property acct_type). Each customer is identified by its social security number (ssn); a customer can be granted several loans and open as many accounts as s/he wishes.\n2.1 Exercises Exercise\nExercise 2.1 Which primary key would you choose for the entity Bank? Justify your answer. Solution\nSince no two banks have the same code_bank or name, either property can be chosen as the primary key of the entity Bank. Both can be considered as valid candidate keys.\nExercise\nExercise 2.2 Would you consider {code_bank, name} as a valid candidate key for the entity Bank? Justify your answer. Solution\nThe answer is no. While there aren’t any banks that have the same value for {code_bank, name}, two subsets ({code_bank} and {name}) are candidate keys.\nExercise\nExercise 2.3 Complete the diagram in the figure by adding the cardinalities to the relations.

The dealership sells both new and used cars, and it operates a service facility. The database should keep data about the cars (serial number, make, model, color, whether it is new or used), the salespeople (first and family name) and the customers (first and family name, phone number, address). Also, the following business rules hold:\nA salesperson may sell many cars, but each car is sold by only one salesperson. A customer may buy many cars, but each car is bought by only one customer. A salesperson writes a single invoice for each car s/he sells. The invoice is identified by a number and indicates the sale date and the price. A customer gets an invoice for each car s/he buys. When a customer takes one or more cars in for repair, one service ticket is written for each car. The ticket is identified by a number and indicates the date on which the car is received from the customer, as well as the date on which the car should be returned to the customer. A car brought in for service can be worked on by many mechanics, and each mechanic may work on many cars.\n3.1 Exercises Exercise\nExercise 3.1 Give the conceptual schema of the database with an ER diagram.

You can call the new database pagila (or any name you want).\nDownload the dump file pagila-insert-data.sql This file contains all the SQL statements necessary to create the tables of the database and populate them with some data.\nRight-click on the new database, select Query tool.\nClick on the second (from the left) small icon on the top menu of the query tool to open a new file.\nThrough the interface, locate pagila-schema.sql and open it.\nHit on the F5 button or click on the play icon on the top menu of the query tool to execute the script.\nThe previous steps should have created the schema of the database\nand inserted the data.\nYou can see the list of tables by selecting (on the left menu) Schemas, public, Tables (15 tables should appear).\nOpen a new query tool to do the exercises.\nIntegrity constraints Exercise\nExercise 1 Execute the following statement:\ninsert into film_actor values(1, 25) What is this statement supposed to do? What is the reaction of the DBMS?\nSolution\nThis statement should insert a new row in table film_actor, where the value of actor_id is 1 and the value of film_id is 25.\nThe DBMS returns an error because there is already a row with these values and the two columns film_actor, film_id form the primary key.\nExercise\nExercise 2 Write the statement to delete the film with film_id=1 from the table Film.\nExecute the command. What happens?\nSolution\ndelete from film where film_id=1 The statement is rejected because there are rows in other tables that reference the row that we intend to delete. This is the effect of the foreign key constraint.\nExercise\nExercise 3 Look at the definition of the foreign key constraints in table film_actor (right-click on the table, select Constraints, foreign key).\nIs the definition of the foreign key constraint to table film coherent with the behavior observed in the previous exercise?\nNB In order to see the options of a foreign key, click on the edit button on the left of the constraint. Then look at the tab Action.\nSolution\nThe foreign key linking table film_actor to table film is defined with the option RESTRICT on delete. This is coherent with the behavior that we observed in the previous exercise. Referenced rows cannot be deleted if there are still referencing rows.\nExercise\nExercise 4 Execute the following query:\nSELECT f.film_id as film_id_in_table_film, fa.film_id AS film_id_in_table_film_actor, fa.actor_id as actor_id, f.title as title FROM film f JOIN film_actor fa ON f.film_id = fa.film_id WHERE f.title='ACE GOLDFINGER' What does the query? Note down the identifier of the film in both tables film and film_actor. (columns film_id_in_table_film and film_id_in_table_film_actor).\nSolution\nThe query returns the list of all actors in the film titled Ace Goldfinger. We note that the identifier of the film in both tables is identical (2), as it should because the query joins the two tables on the equality of these two values.\nExercise\nExercise 5 Write and execute a statement to set the value 10000 to the identifier of the film ACE GOLDFINGER in table Film.\nAfter the modification, execute the query of the previous exercise. What changed? Explain in details what happened.\nSolution\nThe statement to modify the film_id of the given film is as follows:\nUPDATE film SET film_id=10000 WHERE title=‘ACE GOLDFINGER’ After executing the same query as the previous exercise, we see that the identifier of the film has changed in the table film_actor too. This is expected, because the foreign key constraint between the colum film_id in table film_actor and the column film_id in table film has the option ON UPDATE CASCADE. This means that if we modify the identifier of the film in table film, the modification is propagated to all the referencing columns.\nExercise\nExercise 6 Execute the following statement:\nUPDATE film_actor SET film_id=2 WHERE film_id=10000 What does? What happens? Explain.\nSolution\nThe statement intends to set the identifier of the film titled Ace Goldfinger (in the previous exercise we gave it the identifier 10000) back to its original value. However, we execute the statement on the table film_actor. The action is not allowed, as the identifier 2 does not correspond to any film in table film.\nThe foreign key enforces the referential integrity constraint. A row cannot refer to a non-existing entity in the referenced table.\nBasic queries Exercise\nExercise 7 Write the following SQL queries:\nReturn all the information on all customers.\nReturn the first and last name of all customers.\nReturn the first and last name of all customers of the store with identifier 1. Solution\nselect * from customer select first_name, last_name from customer select first_name, last_name from customer where store_id=1 Sorting and paginating Exercise\nExercise 8 Write the following SQL queries:\nReturn the last and first name of all customers.

A single monolithic database is not sufficient anymore to serve all the requests and the company is thinking about distributing the database across several servers (horizontal scalability). However, a relational database does not handle horizontal scalability very well, due to the fact that the data is scattered across numerous tables, as the result of the normalization process. Hence, the Sakila team is turning to you to help them migrate the database from PostgreSQL to MongoDB.\nFor the migration to happen, it is necessary to conceive a suitable data model. From the first discussions with the Sakila management, you quickly understand that one of the main use of the database is to manage (add, update and read) rental information.\n1.1 Description of the relational model The existing data model is recalled in Figure 1.1.\nFigure 1.1: The logical schema of the Sakila database Here is the description of the tables:\nThe table actor lists information for all actors. Columns: actor_id, first_name, last_name.\nThe table address contains address information for customers, staff and stores. Columns: address_id, address, address2, district, city_id, postal_code, phone.\nThe table category lists the categories that can be assigned to a film. Columns: category_id, name.\nThe table city contains a list of cities. Columns: city_id, city, country_id.\nThe table country contains a list of countries. Columns: country_id, country.\nThe table customer contains a list of all customers. Columns: customer_id, store_id, first_name, last_name, email, address_id, active, create_date.\nThe table film is a list of all films potentially in stock in the stores. The actual in-stock copies of each film are represented in the inventory table. Columns: film_id, title, description, release_year, language_id, original_language_id, rental_duration, rental_rate, length.\nThe table film_actor is used to support a many-to-many relationship between films and actors. Columns: film_id, actor_id.\nThe table film_category is used to support a many-to-many relationship between films and categories. Columns: film_id, category_id.\nThe table inventory contains one row for each copy of a given film in a given store. Columns: inventory_id, film_id, store_id.\nThe table language contains possible languages that films can have for their language and original language values. Columns: language_id, name.\nThe table payment records each payment made by a customer, with information such as the amount and the rental being paid for. Columns: payment_id, customer_id, staff_id, rental_id, amount, payment_date.\nThe table rental contains one row for each rental of each inventory item with information about who rented what item, when it was rented, and when it was returned. Columns: rental_id, rental_date, inventory_id, customer_id, return_date, staff_id.\nThe table staff lists all staff members. Columns: staff_id, first_name, last_name, address_id, picture, email, store_id, active, username, password.\nThe table store lists all stores in the system. Columns: store_id, manager_staff_id, address_id.\n2 Data types in MongDB A MongoDB document is represented as a JSON record. However, internally MongoDB serializes the JSON record into a BSON record. In practice, a BSON record is a binary representation of a JSON record.\nExercise\nExercise 2.1 Looking at the specification of BSON, can you tell how many bytes do you need to represent: an integer, a date, a string and a boolean?\nExercise\nExercise 2.2 The size of a document in MongoDB is limited to 16 MiB. Can you tell why there is such a limit?\nThe table rental has four integer columns (rental_id, inventory_id, customer_id, staff_id) and 2 dates (rental_date, return_date).\nThe table customer has three integer columns (customer_id, store_id, address_id), three strings (first_name, last_name and email), one boolean value (active) and one date (create_date).\nExercise\nExercise 2.3 Suppose that we want to create a MongoDB collection to list all rentals, and a separate collection to list all customers.\nEstimate the size of a document in both collections.\nWe make the following assumptions:\nOn average, each character needs 1.5 bytes.\nAn email address is 20 characters long on average.\nA last name is 8 characters long on average.\nA first name is 6 characters long on average. 3 Considerations for the new model Denormalization in MongoDB is strongly encouraged to read and write a record relative to an entity in one single operation.\nIn the following exercises, we explore different options and analyze advantages and disadvantages.\nExercise\nExercise 3.1 Suppose that we create a collection Customer, where each document includes information about a customer.\nSuppose that we embed in each document the list of rentals for a customer.\nHow many rentals can we store for a given customer, knowing that the size of a document in MongoDB cannot exceed 16 MiB?\nExercise\nExercise 3.2 Consider the two following options:\nA collection customer, where each document contains the information about a customer and an embedded list with the information on all the rentals made by the customer. We assume that the average number of rentals per customer is 32.\nA collection rental, where each document contains the information about a rental and an embedded document with the information on the customer that made the rental.\nCompute the size in byte of a document in the two collections.\nExercise\nExercise 3.3 Suppose that we have in our database\n512 customers.\n16384 rentals.\nOn average, each customer has around 32 rentals.\nCompute the size in byte of the collections customer and rental described in the previous question.\nExercise\nExercise 3.4 Based on the answers in the previous questions, discuss advantages and disadvantages of the two options: having a collection customer (solution 1) or a collection rental (solution 2).\nExercise\nExercise 3.5 Look again at the model in Figure 1.1. A rental document doesn’t only need to include information on the customer who made the rental, but also:\nThe staff member who took care of the rental.\nThe inventory item being rented.\nThe payment information.\nQuestions.\nDiscuss the different ways we can include this information in the collections customer and rental.\nBased on the discussion, which solution would you retain? A collection customer or a collection rental?\n4 The data model in MongoDB In the last question, we chose the collection that we intend to create.\nExercise\nExercise 4.1 Give the complete schema (name and type of the properties) of a document in the collection that you chose in the previous question.\nIf the value of any property is an embedded document:\nSpecify the schema of that document too.\nIf any property of an embedded document is an identifier referencing another entity, use that identifier (don’t try, for now, to further denormalize the schema).\nLet’s take a closer look at the storage requirements of the adopted solution. Consider that:\nThe size in bytes of a document storing the information of a staff member is around 64 KiB (65,536 bytes), because we store a profile picture.\nThe size in bytes of a document storing the information of an inventory item is 12 bytes.\nThe size in bytes of a document storing the information about a payment is 20 bytes.\nExercise\nExercise 4.2 If we denote by \\(N_{rental}\\) the number of rentals, what is the size in bytes of the database for the adopted solution? What do you get if we set \\(N_{rental}\\) to \\(10^4\\), \\(10^5\\) or \\(10^6\\) ?\nAlthough the size that we determined in the previous exercise, may not sound impressive, we still have to store other information (films, actors….). If we could save a bit of space, we would be happy.\nExercise\nExercise 4.3 Discuss how you could save some space in the adopted solution.\nHINT. Do you really need to denormalize all data?\nExercise\nExercise 4.4 Propose a solution for all the entities involved and estimate the savings in terms of storage requirements.\n5 The new model In this section we intend to obtain a complete model of the Sakila database.\nExercise\nExercise 5.1 Consider the model that we obtained at the end of the previous section. Which data can you further denormalize?\nExercise\nExercise 5.2 Complete the diagram obtained in the previous exercise so as to obtain a full data model for the Sakila database.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ba4ba7fbfed0b39fe1599ff51a59496f","permalink":"/courses/databases/tutorials/mongodb-data-modeling/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/databases/tutorials/mongodb-data-modeling/","section":"courses","summary":"MongoDB data modeling.","tags":null,"title":"MongoDB data modeling","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" 1 Setup Download MongoDB Compass at this page.\nWatch this video to learn how to start a MongoDB server and connect via MongoDB Compass.\n2 Basic queries We might want to see a list of common operators in this page.\nExercise\nExercise 2.1 Write the following queries in MongoDB:\nReturn all the information on all customers.\nReturn the email of all customers.\nReturn the email of the customers of Canadian stores.\nReturn the identifier of all rentals made by customers from Iran, where the amount paid is strictly greater than 10 dollars.\nReturn the first and last names of the actors who played a role in film 213.\n3 Operations on arrays Useful array operators are listed here.\nExercise\nExercise 3.1 Write the following queries in MongoDB:\nReturn the identifier of the films that have “Behind the Scenes” as special features.\nReturn the identifier of the films that have as special features all of the following: “Commentaries” and “Deleted Scenes”.\nReturn the identifier of all the films where BURT POSEY played a role.\nReturn the identifier of the film that has exactly 15 actors.\n4 Aggregation framework A useful reference for the aggregation pipeline can be found here here.\nExercise\nExercise 4.1 Write the following queries in MongoDB using the aggregation framework:\nReturn the title of the films rented by TOMMY COLLAZO (can you also express this query with the function find()?)\nCount the total amount of payments across all rentals.\nReturn the number of actors of each film.\nSort the films by the number of actors (decreasing order).\nReturn the average number of actors for each film.\nReturn the identifier of the customer who made the most of rentals.\nReturn the first and last name of the customer who made the most of rentals.\nReturn the country where the customers have rented the most of the films in the category “Music”.\n5 Join Operations The join operation is explained here.\nExercise\nExercise 5.1 Write the following queries in MongoDB using the aggregation framework:\nReturn the language of the film with title “ACE GOLDFINGER”.\nReturn all the information about the staff member who took care of rental 2.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2a234b98e2eb6424436aa4c247c5af3e","permalink":"/courses/databases/tutorials/mongodb-queries/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/databases/tutorials/mongodb-queries/","section":"courses","summary":"MongoDB data queries.","tags":null,"title":"MongoDB queries","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" 1 Use case scenario We consider a relational database that holds the data of a chain of DVD stores; the database name is Sakila.\nThe Sakila database is serving an increasing number of queries from staff and customers around the world.

In practice, a BSON record is a binary representation of a JSON record.\nExercise\nExercise 2.1 Looking at the specification of BSON, can you tell how many bytes do you need to represent: an integer, a date, a string and a boolean?\nSolution\nFrom the specification we learn that each type is identified by a 1-byte value, for instance \\x01 (that represents the binary string 0000 0001) indicates the type double.\nThe integer type is identified by the value \\x10 and the documentation specifies that we need 32 bits, that is 4 bytes.\nThe date type is identified by the value \\x09 and the documentation specifies that we need an int64, which means an integer coded over 64 bits, that is 8 bytes.\nThe string type is identified by the value \\x02 and the documentation specifies that the string is encoded in UTF-8. A UTF-8 character may need between 1 and 4 bytes. Therefore, the number of bytes depends on the length of the string and on the characters used.\nThe boolean type is identified by the value \\x08. We learn from the specification that the value false is encoded with \\x00 and the value true is encoded with \\x01. In both cases, we only need 1 byte.\nExercise\nExercise 2.2 The size of a document in MongoDB is limited to 16 MiB. Can you tell why there is such a limit?\nSolution\nThis choice is driven by two reasons:\nEnsure that a single document does not use too much memory.\nEnsure that a document does not use too much bandwidth when it is transmitted over the network.\nThe reasons are specified in the MongoDB manual.\nThe table rental has four integer columns (rental_id, inventory_id, customer_id, staff_id) and 2 dates (rental_date, return_date).\nThe table customer has three integer columns (customer_id, store_id, address_id), three strings (first_name, last_name and email), one boolean value (active) and one date (create_date).\nExercise\nExercise 2.3 Suppose that we want to create a MongoDB collection to list all rentals, and a separate collection to list all customers.\nEstimate the size of a document in both collections.\nWe make the following assumptions:\nOn average, each character needs 1.5 bytes.\nAn email address is 20 characters long on average.\nA last name is 8 characters long on average.\nA first name is 6 characters long on average. Solution\nA document in the collection rental would need:\n16 bytes for the integer values (each integer needs 4 bytes, a rental has 4 integer values).\n16 bytes for the dates (each date needs 8 bytes, a rental has 2 dates).\nIn total, a document in collection rental needs 32 bytes.\nA document in collection customer would need:\n12 bytes for the integer values (each integer needs 4 bytes, a customer has 3 integer values).\n\\(20 \\times 1.5\\) = 30 bytes for the email address.\n\\(8 \\times 1.5\\) = 12 bytes for the last name.\n\\(6 \\times 1.5\\) = 9 bytes for the first name.\n1 byte for the property active.\n8 bytes for the property create_date.\nIn total, a document in collection customer needs 72 bytes.\n3 Considerations for the new model Denormalization in MongoDB is strongly encouraged to read and write a record relative to an entity in one single operation.\nIn the following exercises, we explore different options and analyze advantages and disadvantages.\nExercise\nExercise 3.1 Suppose that we create a collection Customer, where each document includes information about a customer.\nSuppose that we embed in each document the list of rentals for a customer.\nHow many rentals can we store for a given customer, knowing that the size of a document in MongoDB cannot exceed 16 MiB?\nSolution\nWe’ve seen before that each rental needs 32 (\\(2^5\\)) bytes.\nConsidering that 16 MiB = \\(2^4 \\times 2^{20}\\) bytes, the maximum number of rentals that we can store for a given customer is given by:\n\\[ \\frac{2^4 \\times 2^{20}}{2^5} = 2^{-1} \\times 2^{20} = 2^{19} \\]\nThis gives around 534,000 rentals.\nExercise\nExercise 3.2 Consider the two following options:\nA collection customer, where each document contains the information about a customer and an embedded list with the information on all the rentals made by the customer.\nA collection rental, where each document contains the information about a rental and an embedded document with the information on the customer that made the rental.\nCompute the size in byte of a document in the two collections.\nSolution\nA document describing a customer needs 72 bytes. A rental document needs 32 bytes, which includes customer_id (an integer, 4 bytes). We might want to drop this property, since we’re embedding a rental document into a customer document. Therefore, for each rental we need 28 bytes. A document in the collection customer needs: \\(72 + 28 \\times 32\\) = 968 bytes.\nFor a rental, we need 32 bytes, which includes customer_id (an integer, 4 bytes). We drop this property, since we’re replacing it with a property customer, whose value is a document with all the information about a customer. Hence, we need 28 bytes to store the information on a rental and 72 bytes to store the information about a customer. In total: 100 bytes.\nExercise\nExercise 3.3 Suppose that we have in our database\n512 customers.\n16384 rentals.\nOn average, each customer has around 32 rentals.\nCompute the size in byte of the collections customer and rental described in the previous question.\nSolution\nThe size the collection customer is \\(512 \\times 968\\) = 495,616 bytes. This corresponds to 484 KiB.\nThe size of the collection rental is \\(16384 \\times 100\\) = 1,638,400 bytes. This corresponds to 1,56 MiB.\nExercise\nExercise 3.4 Based on the answers in the previous questions, discuss advantages and disadvantages of the two options: having a collection customer (solution 1) or a collection rental (solution 2).\nSolution\nAdvantages of solution 1:\nNo redundancy. In fact, a rental is relative to only one customer, therefore the data on a rental is not duplicated across different documents.\nThis also explains why the collection customer is smaller than the the collection rental (although this is also due to the fact that we’ll always have more rentals than customers).\nFor each customer, we retrieve the information on all his/her rentals with only one read operation.\nDisadvantages of solution 1:\nThere is a limit (albeit an acceptable one) on the number of rentals that we can store for each customer.\nThe size of a document is not constant and it depends on the number of rentals of a customer. In the previous questions, we see that for a modest number of rentals a document in collection customer is ten times larger than a document in collection rental.\nAdvantages of solution 2:\nThe size of each document is constant and small and will never exceed the 16 MiB limit.\nAs a result, reading a document from the collection takes less time and memory than reading a document from the collection in solution 1.\nDisadvantages of solution 2:\nThere is redundancy. The information about a customer is replicated each time the customer makes a rental.\nAs a result, the size of the collection is much higher than in solution 1.\nExercise\nExercise 3.5 Look again at the model in Figure 1.1. A rental document doesn’t only need to include information on the customer who made the rental, but also:\nThe staff member who took care of the rental.\nThe inventory item being rented.\nThe payment information.\nQuestions.\nDiscuss the different ways we can include this information in the collections customer and rental.\nBased on the discussion, which solution would you retain? A collection customer or a collection rental?\nSolution\nIn collection customer:\nWe follow a denormalized schema, and we associate all this information into the document that describes a rental. The size of a document in this collection grows further. Besides, since a staff member or an inventory item may be involved in more than one rental, we lose one of the advantages of this solution, which was the lack of redundancy. Consider also that an inventory item is associated with other information (such as, the film the item is a copy of). In this collection, we have different layers of nested documents.\nWe follow a normalized schema, we create collections staff, inventory and payment and we add references to these collections in the customer documents. However, a normalized schema might not be efficient in a distributed context.\nIn collection rental:\nWe follow a denormalized schema and we associate this information into the document that describes a rental. The size of the document grows, but it is always constant and small. In fact, we don’t embed any unbounded list of values. Given these considerations, we go for solution 2.\n4 The data model in MongoDB In the last question, we chose the collection that we intend to create.\nExercise\nExercise 4.1 Give the complete schema (name and type of the properties) of a document in the collection that you chose in the previous question.\nIf the value of any property is an embedded document:\nSpecify the schema of that document too.\nIf any property of an embedded document is an identifier referencing another entity, use that identifier (don’t try, for now, to further denormalize the schema).\nSolution\nA document in the collection rental has the following properties:\nrental_id, an integer. rental_date, a date. return_date, a date. inventory, a document with information about the inventory item being rented. This document has the following schema: inventory_id, an integer. film_id, an integer. store_id, an integer. customer, a document with information about the customer making the rental. This document has the following schema: customer_id, an integer. store_id, an integer. first_name, a string. last_name, a string. email, a string. address_id, an integer. active, a boolean. create_date, a date. staff, a document with information about the staff member who handled the rental. This document has the following schema: staff_id, an integer. first_name, a string. last_name, a string. address_id, an integer. picture, binary data. email, a string. store_id, an integer active, a boolean username, a string. password, a string. payment, document with information about the payment of the rental: payment_id, an integer. amount, a real number. payment_date, a date Note that the payment table in the relational model include columns customer_id, staff_id and rental_id; these are not necessary in the embedded document payment, because we already have this information.\nLet’s take a closer look at the storage requirements of the adopted solution. Consider that:\nThe size in bytes of a document storing the information of a staff member is around 64 KiB (65,536 bytes), because we store a profile picture.\nThe size in bytes of a document storing the information of an inventory item is 12 bytes.\nThe size in bytes of a document storing the information about a payment is 20 bytes.\nExercise\nExercise 4.2 If we denote by \\(N_{rental}\\) the number of rentals, what is the size in bytes of the database for the adopted solution? What do you get if we set \\(N_{rental}\\) to \\(10^4\\), \\(10^5\\) or \\(10^6\\) ?\nSolution\nIn a previous question, we saw that a document in the collection rental, including the information about a customer, needs 100 bytes. We need to add the size of the documents inventory, staff and payment. Therefore, we obtain: 100 + 12 + 20 + 65,536. The size of the document staff is far superior than the size of the other documents. We can approximate the size to 64 KiB.\nThe size of the only collection rental (hence, of the whole database) is: \\(N_{rentals} \\times 64 KiB\\)\nIf \\(N_{rentals}\\)=10,000, the size of the database is 640 MiB (if we consider 1 MiB = 1000 KiB). If \\(N_{rentals}\\)=100,000, the size of the database is 6,4 GiB (if we consider 1 GiB = 1000,000 KiB) If \\(N_{rentals}\\)=1,000,000 the size of the database is 64 GiB. Although the size that we determined in the previous exercise, may not sound impressive, we still have to store other information (films, actors….). If we could save a bit of space, we would be happy.\nExercise\nExercise 4.3 Discuss how you could save some space in the adopted solution.\nHINT. Do you really need to denormalize all data?\nSolution\nWhile modeling data for a MongoDB database, the choice between a normalized and a denormalized schema does not need to be a black and white one.\nWe can have a denormalized schema, where we embed in the same documents information that are queried together, while storing in a separate collection the information that are rarely queried.\nFor instance, the profile picture of a staff member might not be an important piece of information while we’re trying to analyze which staff members are the more productive ones.\nSo, we might add another collection Staff where each document only contains attributes that are not in embedded documents in the collection Rental.\nExercise\nExercise 4.4 Propose a solution for all the entities involved and estimate the savings in terms of storage requirements.\nSolution\nHere is a solution with three different collections. The information on inventory are completely denormalized into the collection Rental. For customers and staff members we only keep the necessary information and we normalize the information that are less likely to be queried while analyzing the rentals.\nLet’s try to estimate the savings in terms of storage. In a document of the collection Rental, we have the following attributes:\nrental_id: 4 bytes.\nrental_date and return_date: 16 bytes.\ninventory_id, film_id and store_id: 12 bytes\ncustomer_id: 4 bytes\ncustomer first_name: 9 bytes.\ncustomer last_name: 12 bytes.\ncountry: 15 bytes (on average a country name has 10 characters).\nstaff_id: 4 bytes\nstaff first_name: 9 bytes.\nstaff last_name: 12 bytes.\nIn total a document in our collection rental will have 97 bytes (a huge improvement wrt the 64KiB bytes of our first solution).\nOf course, the size of a document in the staff collection will be around 64 KiB (we still store the profile picture). However, the number of staff members \\(N_{staff}\\) is much lower than the number of rentals \\(N_{rentals}\\).\nIt is easy to verify that the size of a document of the collection customer is 51 bytes. Again, the number of customers \\(N_{customers}\\) is much lower than \\(N_{rentals}\\).\nWe assume that each customer has on average 30 rentals and for 100 customers we have 1 staff member. We have that:\n$N_{customer} = N_{rental}/30 $\n$N_{staff} = N_{customer}/100 = N_{rental}/3000 $\nSo, the size of the database will be given by:\n\\[ 97\\times N_{rentals} + 65536 \\times N_{rentals}/3000 + 51 \\times N_{rentals}/30 \\approx 120 \\times N_{rental} \\]\nLet’s compare against the first solution:\nIf \\(N_{rentals}\\) = 10,000 the size of the database is 1,2 MiB (instead of 640 MiB).\nIf \\(N_{rentals}\\) = 100,000 the size of the database is 12 MiB (instead of 6,4 GiB).\nIf \\(N_{rentals}\\) = 1,000,000 the size of the database is 120 MiB (instead of 64 GiB).\nAs you can see, a big improvement! And we have a (partially) denormalized schema that lets us take advantage of the horizontal scalability of MongoDB.\n5 The new model In this section we intend to obtain a complete model of the Sakila database.\nExercise\nExercise 5.1 Consider the model that we obtained at the end of the previous section. Which data can you further denormalize?\nSolution\nCollection Staff\nThe attribute address_id refers to a full address. We can fully denormalize this information into the documents of the collection. Although an address might be the same for two people, the level of redundancy will be very low.\nThe attribute store_id refers to the store where the staff member works. The store table in the original PostgreSQL database does not have too many columns. Therefore, it might be reasonable to fully denormalize these data. However, information on the stores are also linked to customers and to inventory items. If we need to update, say, the manager of a store, we would need to update three different documents. Hence, we prefer to create a collection store and keep in the documents of the collection staff only the city and country of a store (and its identifier of course).\nAttribute inventory in collection customer\nSame considerations for the attribute store_id.\nThe attribute film_id is the reference to the film the inventory item is a copy of. The table film in the original PostgreSQL database contains 14 columns. This high number of attributes advises us against a full denormalization, considering that might have several inventory items for a film. We might only keep the film title and the film categories. The rest of the attributes are kept in documents of a separate collection film.\nCollection customer\nSame considerations for the attributes store_id and address_id.\nExercise\nExercise 5.2 Complete the diagram obtained in the previous exercise so as to obtain a full data model for the Sakila database.\nSolution\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"bf16f218532876a9d1423fc57b1b66a4","permalink":"/courses/plp/tutorials/mongodb-modeling/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/plp/tutorials/mongodb-modeling/","section":"courses","summary":"MongoDB data modeling.","tags":null,"title":"MongoDB modeling","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" We learn how to write queries in MongoDB on the Sakila database.\n1 Initialization Launch a MongoDB server on your computer.\nOpen MongoDB Compass.\nConnect to the MongoDB server with the following URI: mongodb://localhost:27017.\nDownload the this archive file and extract it.

The paths to the two files are already available in variables training_set_file and test_set_file defined at Lines 40 and 43 respectively.\nSolution\nThe solutions are available in file:\n/usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib_solutions/train_test.py 2 Preparing the features In both training and test sets, the features correspond to DataFrame columns. Most of the machine learning algorithms in Spark need to have all features in one single vector. We need to use a transformer.\nGood to know\nTransformers take in a DataFrame and return a new DataFrame that has the same columns as the input DataFrame and additional columns that are specified as an argument to the transformer.\nCopy the file train_test_model to your home folder in the cluster by typing the following command:\ncp /usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib/train_test_model.py .\nExercise\nExercise 2.1 Implement the function read_training_set at Line 22. The file reads into a Spark DataFrame the training set Parquet file that you generated in the previous section.\nImplement the function read_test_function at Line 39. The file reads into a Spark DataFrame the test set Parquet file that you generated in the previous section.\nModify the variables at Line 105 and 106 so that they point to the two HDFS Parquet files that contain the training and test sets.\nUncomment Lines 109 and 110, so as to print the number of training and test instances.\nExecute the file train_test_model with spark-submit. Check that the number of training and test instances correspond to what you got in the first section.\nSolution\nThe solutions are available in file:\n/usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib_solutions/train_test_model.py It is now time to learn how to use a transformer to put all the necessary features into a vector. For the time being, we’ll only be using the feature bedrooms to predict the price.\nExercise\nExercise 2.2 Implement the function get_vector at Line 55. The comments in the file describe what the function is supposed to do. You’ll need to use a VectorAssembler object to implement the function.\nUncomment Lines 117 and 118 to call the function get_vector and display the result.\nExecute the file train_test_model with spark-submit. Observe the content of the the DataFrame train_vect. It should have a column named features containing a list with one value (the value of feature bedrooms).\nSolution\nThe solutions are available in file:\n/usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib_solutions/train_test_model.py It is now time to train a linear regression model on the given training set and the selected features.\nExercise\nExercise 2.3 Implement the function train_linear_regression_model at Line 79. The comments in the file describe what the function is supposed to do. Looking at the documentation, try to identify the object that you need to use to create a linear regressor and the function that you need to invoke to train the linear regressor.\nUncomment Lines 121, 124, 125, 126 to call the function train_linear_regression_model and display the coefficients learned by the linear regression model.\nExecute the file train_test_model with spark-submit. Solution\nThe solutions are available in file:\n/usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib_solutions/train_test_model.py We can now use the trained model to make some predictions. The model returned by the function that you implemented in the previous exercise is an object of type LinearRegressionModel. Looking at the documentation, we learn that there is a function predict that allows us to make a prediction given a single instance. If we want to make a prediction on the whole test set, we should use the function transform. The function takes in a DataFrame with the test set and returns the same DataFrame with an additional column prediction that contains the predicted value.\nExercise\nExercise 2.4 Look at Lines 130 and 131. Which DataFrame do we need to pass the function transform? Is test_df a good choice? Why?\nComplete line 130 and uncomment lines 130, 131, 132.\nExecute the file train_test_model with spark-submit and observe the result. Is the predicted value the one that you expect given that you know the formula of the regression line? Solution\ntest_df is not a good choice. In fact, the test set DataFrame must have the same format as the training set DataFrame the model has been trained on. So, we need to transform it a vecAssembler.\nThe solutions are available in file:\n/usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib_solutions/train_test_model.py 3 Pipelines In the previous section we learned that a training and test set need to go through the same transformation steps in order to be fed to a machine learning model. When we have few transformations, it is easy to remember the ones that we applied to a training set, so as to apply them to the test set too. However, when we need to apply a series of transformations, the order of which is important, it is easy to make mistakes (applying different sets of transformations to the training and test instances, which leads to meaningless predictions).\nA good practice is to use the Pipeline API. A pipeline is composed of stages. Each stage may be a transformer or an estimator. A transformer is an object on which we call the function transform to obtain a new DataFrame from an input DataFrame. An estimator is an object on which we call the function fit to learn a model on a given DataFrame. The learned model is itself a transformer.\nWhen the function fit is called on a Pipeline, the training set goes through all the transformers and the estimators in the order in which they are declared in the pipeline; at last, the estimator specified in the last stage is trained on the training set. The model returned by applying the function fit on the pipeline is itself a transformer. If we invoke the function transform on that model on the test set, we obtain a DataFrame that contains a column named predictions. Implicitly, all the transformations in the pipeline will be applied to the test set too, before making the predictions.\nCopy the file pipeline_example.py to your home folder in the cluster by typing the following command:\ncp /usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib/pipeline_example.py . Exercise\nExercise 3.1 Look at the documentation and write a code from Line 34 to create a pipeline that does the same operations as in file train_test_model.py to train and test a linear regression model on the given training and test sets.\nDon’t forget to specify the paths to the training and test set files on HDFS at Lines 27 and 28. Solution\nSolutions available in file:\n/usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib_solutions/pipeline_example.py 3.1 From categorical to numerical features Many machine learning models do not handle categorical values: they need all features to be numerical. Linear regression is such an example.\nActivity\nCopy the file onehot_playground.py to your home directory in the cluster by typing the following command: cp /usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib/onehot_playground.py . Change lines 27 and 28 and write the paths to the files with the training and test sets. First, let’s find out which features are categorical in our dataset.\nExercise\nExercise 3.2 Complete the function get_categorical_columns.\nIn order to get an idea as to how to get the categorical columns, execute the code with spark_submit. This execute the instruction at Line 86.\nOnce you’re done with the implementation, execute the file with spark-submit and observe the output.\nSolution\nSolutions available in file:\n/usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib_solutions/onehot_playground.py One example of categorical feature in our dataset is property_type, which takes values such as Apartment, House, Condominium… Each value of a categorical feature is also referred to as a category.\nOne way to turn this feature into a numerical one would be to assign a number to each category (e.g., Apartment corresponds to 0, House to 1….). However, this implicitly introduces an order among the categories: the category House would be worth twice as much as the category Apartment; this would inevitably bias the trained model.\nA commonly used method is one-hot encoding. Let’s find out how it works. Let’s focus only on the feature property_type.\nActivity\nUncomment Lines 40, 41 and 42. These lines instantiate an estimator that is called StringIndexer. This estimator associates numeric indexes to the values of property_type. The indexes will be stored in another column named property_type_index.\nUncomment Line 46. The StringIndexer is applied to the training set to learn how to associate indexes to the values of property_type. The result of the instruction is a new transformer.\nUncomment Line 49. The transformer learned on Line 46 is used to transform the training set into a new DataFrame. This DataFrame contains an additional column called property_type_index.\nExercise\nExercise 3.3 Complete the function count_property_types. Follow the instructions in the file.\nOnce the function is complete, uncomment Line 53 to call the function.\nExecute the file with spark-submit and observe the output. Can you guess how the indexes are assigned to the categories of the feature property_type?\nSolution\nSolutions available in file:\n/usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib_solutions/onehot_playground.py We note that the most frequent property type obtains the index 0; the second most frequent will obtain value 1…so the indexes are attributed by frequency. Each time we run the same code, we obtain the same indexes. This means that we have a determinism over different executions of the same program.\nIt is time to find out how one-hot encoding works.\nActivity\nUncomment Lines 57, 58, 61, 64, 67. These lines instantiate an estimator that is called OneHotEncoder. This estimator uses the indexes in property_type_index and creates a new column property_type_ohe.\nThe estimator is trained on the training set and a new transformer is obtained (line 61).\nThe transformer is used on the training set to transform it into a new DataFrame, where a new column property_type_ohe exists.\nLine 67 prints selected columns of this transformed training set.\nExercise\nExercise 3.4 Execute the file with spark-submit.\nCan you understand how one-hot encoding works? Solution\nSolutions available in file:\n/usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib_solutions/onehot_playground.py One-hot creates a vector with as many values as the number of categories in the feature property_type. Each category has a fixed index in this vector, given by the column property_type_index. If for an instance the value of the property_type is Guest suite and the index of Guest suite is 3, then the one-hot encoded vector has only a value 1 at index 3 and 0 anywhere else. Spark only stores a concise representation of this sparse vector: a tuple with the size of the vector, the index whose value is non-zero and the actual value associated to the index (1 in our case).\nNow, you have all the ingredients to create a full pipeline to train and test a linear regression model by using all features.\nExercise\nExercise 3.5 Create a new file full_pipeline.py where:\nYou select the categorical features.\nSet up a StringIndexer and a OneHotEncoder to apply one-hot encoding to all categorical features.\nObtain the numeric features.\nSet up a VectorAssembler to put into a single vector the one-hot encoded features and the numerical ones.\nSet up a linear regression model that takes in all features and the variable to predict (price).\nMix all these ingredients in a Pipeline.\nUse the Pipeline to train and test the model. Solution\nSolutions available in file:\n/usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib_solutions/full_pipeline.py 4 Evaluating a model In the previous sections we visually looked at the predictions to get an vague idea of how our estimator performs. In order to quantify the quality of our estimator, we need some evaluation measures.\nExercise\nExercise 4.1 Look at the documentation and play with the code to do model selection based on a grid search of parameters.\nSolution\nThe solutions are available in file\n/usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib_solutions/model_evaluation.py ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8f586ec6d371aecd5f847f0a84fce843","permalink":"/courses/plp/tutorials/mllib/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/plp/tutorials/mllib/","section":"courses","summary":"MLlib lab.","tags":null,"title":"Spark MLlib","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"137dc9cba074d30d32fe28b9317e31f8","permalink":"/courses/bdia_old/tutorials/structured-streaming-lab/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/bdia_old/tutorials/structured-streaming-lab/","section":"courses","summary":"Description of the lab structured streaming.","tags":null,"title":"Spark structured streaming","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" 1 Introduction The goal of this tutorial is to learn how to analyze streams of data with the Spark Structured Streaming API.\nDocumentation\nIn order to answer the questions and do the exercises, you might want to refer to the following documentation:\nThe Structured Streaming programming guide.\nThe Spark SQL API reference.\n2 Warming up Copy the file warmup.py to your home folder by typing the following command: cp /usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/structured_streaming/warmup.py . Exercise\nExercise 2.1 Read the code and answer the following questions.\nWhere does this program get its input from?\nWhat object type does the variable lines contain (instruction at Line 28)?\nWhere does this program write its output?\nWhat is the output of this program?\nWhat is the option checkpointLocation intended for?\nWhat does the instruction streamingQuery.awaitTermination()?\nYou can now verify your answers to the previous questions by executing the program.\nActivity\nCreate a checkpoint directory for the first exercise (e.g., checkpoint_dir) under your home directory hdfs://sar17:9000/plpspark22/plpspark22_X in HDFS. The command to do so is as follows: hdfs dfs -mkdir hdfs://sar17:9000/plpspark22/plpspark22_X/checkpoint_dir Complete line 21 of file warmup.py. Choose a port number in the interval [49152, 65535].\nComplete line 25 of file warmup.py. Write the path to the checkpoint location that you created on step 1.\nOpen a new terminal window and connect to the same kyle machine to which you’re connected in the first terminal window:\nssh kyleXX In the new terminal window, start a netcat server. Use the following command. Replace [port_number] with the port number that you chose on step 2. The command will hang waiting for some input. This is normal. nc -lk [port_number] In the old terminal window, execute the Spark program with spark-submit. Wait until Spark displays the content of the first micro-batch. In case the program stops for an error, remove all files generated in the checkpoint location with the following command and restart the Spark program. hdfs dfs -rm -r hdfs://sar17:9000/plpspark22/plpspark22_X/checkpoint_dir/* In the terminal window where the netcat server is running, write few lines of text. Look at the terminal where the Spark program is running and observe the output. Stop the program\nWhen you’re done with your experiments, you can stop the Spark program by simply typing CTRL-C in the terminal where Spark is running.\nRemove all files in the checkpoint directory.\nhdfs dfs -rm -r hdfs://sar17:9000/plpspark22/plpspark22_X/checkpoint_dir/* Don’t stop the netcat server, you’ll need it in the next exercise. 3 Triggers In a Structured Streaming program we can choose a trigger type. A trigger determines when the streaming source is checked for new data.\nBy looking at the Structured Streaming programming guide, answer the following questions.\nExercise\nExercise 3.1 What is the trigger type in the previous program?\nModify the code of the previous program in order to set the Fixed interval micro-batches trigger type. Set an interval of 10 seconds.\nRun the program. Write many lines back to back on the netcat server. How is the behavior of this program different from before?\n4 Checkpoint location and output mode We’re now going to see the impact of the checkpoint location and the output modes on a streaming query.\nExercise\nExercise 4.1 Look again at the Structured Streaming programming guide, and check the options for the output mode.\nWhat is the output mode of the previous program? You’re now going to code a program that counts the number of occurrences of each word in a streaming data source. But first do the actions that you find in the following Activity.\nActivity\nCreate a copy of the file warmup.py and rename it to wordcount.py by typing the following command: cp warmup.py wordcount.py Remove all files in the checkpoint location by typing the following command: hdfs dfs -rm -r hdfs://sar17:9000/plpspark22/plpspark22_X/checkpoint_dir/* Exercise\nExercise 4.2 Before you code the program, you should first answer the following questions:\nObserve the output of a batch in the previous executions of the Spark programs. What is the type of the output?\nGiven the type of the output, which Spark API are you going to use to code the program?\nWhich operations do you need to execute to count the number of occurrences of each word across batches? For the moment, don’t worry about the specific functions you need to use, just think in abstract terms.\nLook at the Structured Streaming programming guide. Which output mode can’t you use? Why? Exercise\nExercise 4.3 Add to the file wordcount.py the instructions to count the number of occurrences of each word in the stream. Where are you going to add the new instructions?\nBased on the answer to the previous exercises, set the appropriate output mode. You have two choices. Try one of them.\nMake sure that the netcat server is still running.\nRun the program with spark-submit. In the netcat terminal, write few lines and observe the output of the Spark program.\nStop the Spark program and run it again with no modifications. The first time you get a java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException. Don’t lose your hope and run it again.\nWrite few lines in the netcat terminal and observe the output of the Spark program. What can you say about the word counts?\nStop the program and remove the files in the checkpoint location. Run the program again and write few lines on the netcat terminal. What can you say about the word counts?\nRun the program again with a different output mode and observe the result.\n5 Window operations on event time Netcat and checkpoint\nImportant actions to do!\nStop the netcat server now.\nRemove all files from the checkpoint directory.\nWe’re now going to find out how to perform aggregations over a sliding event-time window.\nA given data source generates two words every second for a certain amount of time. Each word is accompanied with a timestamp that indicates the exact moment when the word is generated. This timestamp is the event time.\nAfter generating a word, the data source saves the word and its timestamp into a CSV file in a directory on HDFS. For convenience, we’ll refer to this directory as the source directory.\nAt any given moment, the source will contain zero to many CSV files, where each file only contains exactly one line in the format word,timestamp (no whitespace before nor after the comma).\nActivity\nCreate the source directory under your home directory in HDFS, by typing the following command: hdfs dfs -mkdir hdfs://sar17:9000/plpspark22/plpspark22_X/source_dir Copy to your home directory the file tempws_gen.py (the data source) by typing the following command: the data generator that you find at the following path cp /usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/structured_streaming/tempws_gen.py . Copy to your home directory the file win_events.py by typing the following command: cp /usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/structured_streaming/win_events.py . You now need to complete the code in file win_events.py.\nExercise\nExercise 5.1 Open the file win_events.py.\nComplete Line 19. Specify the path to the source directory that you created in the previous activity.\nComplete Line 31. Write the query to count the number of occurrences of each word within a 10 second window that slides every 5 seconds. Look at the documentation of the window function to learn how to do it.\nComplete Line 34. Specify the path to the checkpoint directory.\nComplete Line 40. Write the code to write the output of the streaming query to console. Use triggers of 5 seconds. Use the output mode update. Don’t forget to specify the location of the checkpoint directory. Execute win_events.py with spark-submit. If you get some errors, stop the program. Correct the errors in the code and then re-execute the program again. If no error arises, the program should hang waiting for some input. Let the program wait and go on to the next exercise. We now test the Spark program.\nActivity\nOpen a new terminal window and type the following command to connect to the same kyle machine where you’re connected in the first terminal window: ssh kyleXX Execute the data generator program by typing the following command (remember to replace X with your account number!): python3 tempws_gen.py -s hdfs://sar17:9000/plpspark22/plpspark22_X/source_dir After launching the data generator, you should see some output in the terminal window where you launched the Spark program. Wait for the script tempws_gen.py to terminate the data generation.\nIf you need to rerun the Spark program and the data generator, make sure you delete all the files in the checkpoint location and the source directory.\nWe now want to analyze the output of the program.\nActivity\nCreate a new folder on your own computer (not the computers in the cluster) and open it in a new Visual Studio Code window. For the sake of simplicity, let’s call this folder window_analysis.\nThe script tempws_gen.py has generated a file gen_words.csv in your home directory in the cluster. This file contains the list of all words generated with the relative timestamps.\nOpen gen_words.csv and copy the whole content.\nCreate a new file gen_words.csv under window_analysis and paste the content that you copied on the previous step.\nCopy the file timeline_visualization.py into your home folder in the cluster by typing the following command:\ncp /usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/structured_streaming/timeline_visualization.py . Open the file timeline_visualization.py and copy all its content.\nCreate a new file timeline_visualization.py under window_analysis and paste the content that you copied on the previous step.\nIn the Visual Studio Code window where you opened window_analysis, open a terminal and run the following command: WARNING. If you’re on macOS, you should type python3 instead of python.\npython timeline_visualization.py -i gen_words.csv -ft [first timestamp] -lt [last timestamp] -it 5 where:\ngen_words.csv is the file that you previously created.\nReplace first timestamp with the earliest timestamp associated with the windows (look at the output of your Spark program).\nReplace last timestamp with the last timestamp associated with the windows (look at the output of your Saprk program).\nThe option -i is used to specify the interval between two consecutive triggers.\nThe visualization tool displays a vertical blue bar at each trigger. This is why you need to pass the tool the timestamps associated to the first and last trigger and the interval (in seconds) between two consecutive triggers.\nExercise\nExercise 5.2 Analyze the output of your Spark program and the timeline of the generated words.\nDescribe how the counts are updated by the Spark program. 6 Late data and watermarking We’re now going to learn how Structured Streaming handles late data in windowed aggregations.\nRemove generated files\nRemove all the files in the source directory.\nRemove all the files in the checkpoint directory.\nThe data generator tempws_gen.py can generate a stream of words, some of which might be written to the directory tempws with some amount of delay. In other words, there is a gap between the event time (when the word is generated) and the processing time (when the word is written to the directory).\nGood to know\nTo generate data with some delay you can use the following command (remember to replace the X with your account number!):\npython3 tempws_gen.py -s hdfs://sar17:9000/plpspark22/plpspark22_X/source_dir --delay 0.8 In the previous command, the 0.8 indicates that the probability that an event arrives with some delay is 80%. The delay is between 5 and 15 seconds. You can adjust these values by using the appropriate options. To learn more, type the following command:\npython3 tempws_gen.py --help Spark uses a mechanism called watermarking to specify the maximum delay that an event can take to be counted. If the difference between the arrival time and the event time is higher than a certain threshold (the watermark), the delayed data will be discarded.\nExercise\nExercise 6.1 Write a Spark program that does the same aggregation as in the previous exercise. Additionally, the program must use watermarking to handle late data. You can look at the programming guide to learn how to do it\nStart the Spark program.\nGenerate some data with delay with the program tempws_gen.py. Once the data generation stops, you can stop the Spark program.\nVisualize the generated words with the visualization tool. Late words have the delay indicated between parentheses.\nObserve the output of the Spark program and describe how the watermarking mechanism works on this example.

Refer to this documentation to learn how to connect and interact with the cluster.\nDocumentation\nIn order to answer the questions and do the exercises, you might want to refer to the following documentation:\nThe Structured Streaming programing guide.\nThe Spark SQL API reference.\n1 Warming up Consider the following program.\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession from pyspark.sql.types import * import pyspark.sql.functions as F port_number = COMPLETE HERE checkpoint_location = COMPLETE HERE spark = (SparkSession.builder.appName(\u0026quot;Structured Streaming - exo1\u0026quot;).getOrCreate()) lines = (spark\\ .readStream.format(\u0026quot;socket\u0026quot;)\\ .option(\u0026quot;host\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;localhost\u0026quot;)\\ .option(\u0026quot;port\u0026quot;, port_number)\\ .load()) streamingQuery = lines.writeStream\\ .option(\u0026quot;checkpointLocation\u0026quot;, checkpoint_location)\\ .format(\u0026quot;console\u0026quot;).start() streamingQuery.awaitTermination() Exercise\nExercise 1.1 Where does this program get its input from?\nWhat object type does the variable lines contain?\nWhere does this program write its output?\nWhat is the output of this program?\nWhat is the option checkpointLocation intended for?\nWhat does the instruction streamingQuery.awaitTermination()?\nSolution\nThe input is a socket, where a program generates some data.\nlines is a dataframe.\nTo the console.\nJust copies the input to the output.\nIt is where the Spark program writes the progress of the streaming query.\nThe instructions means that the program will block on this instruction. The program won’t stop until there is data to process.\nYou can now verify your answers to the previous questions by executing the program.\nActivity\nConnect to the cluster, if you haven’t done so yet. Refer to this documentation.\nAfter running the command srun ..., you should be connected to a machine on the cluster Kyle. Note the name of this machine (you should see it at the terminal prompt).\nCreate a checkpoint directory for the first exercise (e.g., checkpoint_exo1) under your home directory hdfs://sar01:9000/cpuecm1/cpuecm1_X in HDFS.\nCopy and paste the code into a Python file (e.g., exo1.py) that you’ll save into your home directory in the local filesystem of the cluster machine. Change the value of the variable checkpoint_location so that it points to the directory that you created at point 3. Change the value of the variable port_number to any value in the range [49152, 65535]. Open a new terminal window, connect to phome.metz.supelec.fr and then to the same machine that you noted at point 2.\nIn the new terminal, start a netcat server listening on the port number that you selected at point 4. Use the following command:\nnc -lk port_number Run the Python code with the command spark-submit. Wait until Spark does not display any more messages on screen. In case the program stops for an error, read the box “What to do in case of errors” below. In the netcat terminal, write few lines of text. Look at the terminal where the Spark program is running and observe the output. What to do in case of errors\nIf any error arises, before running the spark-submit again it would be better to remove all files from the checkpoint directory.\nStop the program\nWhen you’re done with your experiments, you can stop the Spark program by simply typing CTRL-C in the terminal where Spark is running.\nDon’t stop the netcat server, you’ll need it in the next exercise.\nRemove all files from the checkpoint location.\n2 Triggering policy In a Structured Streaming program we can choose a triggering policy.\nExercise\nExercise 2.1 What is a triggering policy?\nWhat is the triggering policy in the previous program?\nModify the code of the previous program in order to set the Fixed interval micro-batch triggering policy.\nRun the program. How is the behaviour of this program different from before?\nSolution\nIt is a policy that dictates the timing of streaming data processing.\nNo triggering policy is specified, so the default is chosen. In practice, as soon as the previous micro-batch finishes processing, the next one is read in.\nHere is the code. We need to specify a `trigger.\nstreamingQuery = lines.writeStream .trigger(processingTime = \u0026quot;15 seconds\u0026quot;) .format(\u0026quot;console\u0026quot;).start() The new data is checked at the specified interval. It is possible that within the specified interval (15 seconds), we write many lines, so the program will get multiple lines in a micro-batch (unlike before, when the processing is triggered as soon as there is data available). 3 Checkpoint location and output mode We’re now going to see the impact of the checkpoint location and the output modes on a streaming query.\nExercise\nExercise 3.1 What is an output mode and what are the available options?\nWhat is the output mode of the previous program? Solution\nThe output mode tells Spark how the output is presented. There are several options: append (only the new rows added to the Result Table since the last trigger are visible in the output), complete (the whole Result Table is visible after each trigger) and update (only the rows that were updated since the last trigger are visible in the output).\nIn the previous program we didn’t specify any output mode, so the default mode (append) is selected. We’re now going to write a new streaming query.\nExercise\nExercise 3.2 Create a new checkpoint location in HDFS. You may also keep the same directory as before; in this case, make sure you remove all files from that directory.\nWrite a new program that reads a streaming text from a TCP socket and counts the number of occurrences of each word.\nWhich output mode are you going to choose and why?\nRun the program. Write few lines on the netcat server and observe the output.\nStop the program and run it again with no modifications. Write few lines in the netcat terminal and observe the output. What can you say about the word counts?\nStop the program and remove the files in the checkpoint location. Run the program again and write few lines on the netcat terminal. What can you say about the word counts?\nPlay with the different output modes and observe how the output changes.\nSolution\nThe new program is as follows:\nlines = (spark\\ .readStream.format(\u0026quot;socket\u0026quot;)\\ .option(\u0026quot;host\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;localhost\u0026quot;)\\ .option(\u0026quot;port\u0026quot;, port_number)\\ .load()) lines = lines.select(F.explode(F.split(lines.value, \u0026quot; \u0026quot;))\\ .alias(\u0026quot;word\u0026quot;))\\ .groupBy(\u0026quot;word\u0026quot;).count() streamingQuery = lines.writeStream\\ .trigger(processingTime = \u0026quot;15 seconds\u0026quot;)\\ .option(\u0026quot;checkpointLocation\u0026quot;, checkpoint_location)\\ .outputMode(\u0026quot;update\u0026quot;)\\ .format(\u0026quot;console\u0026quot;)\\ .start() streamingQuery.awaitTermination() The append mode doesn’t work, because aggregating function might modify previous lines of the ResultTable. So, the only options left are update and complete. We choose update to just have the values that changed since the last trigger.\n4 Window operations on event time Netcat and checkpoint\nYou can stop the netcat server now.\nRemember to create a new checkpoint location for this exercise. Alternatively, you can also use the same directory as in the previous exercises, but you should remove all its files.\nWe’re now going to find out how to perform aggregations over a sliding event-time window.\nA given data source generates some words for a certain time interval. Each word is accompanied with a timestamp that indicates the exact moment when the word is generated. This timestamp is the event time.\nAfter generating a word, the data source saves the word and its timestamp into a CSV file in a directory on HDFS. For convenience, we’ll refer to this directory as the source directory.\nActivity\nCreate the source directory under your home directory hdfs://sar01:9000/cpuecm1/cpuecm1_X in HDFS.\nAt any given moment, the source will contain zero to many CSV files, where each file only contains exactly one line in the format word,timestamp (no whitespace before nor after the comma).\nExercise\nExercise 4.1 Write a Spark program that:\nReads the stream of data from the source directory.\nCounts the number of occurrences of each word within 10 minute windows that slide every 5 minutes.\nPrint the output counts to the console. Use triggers of 5 seconds. Solution\nThe new program is as follows:\nsource_directory = hdfs://.... words = (spark .readStream.format(\u0026quot;csv\u0026quot;) .schema(\u0026quot;word STRING, timestamp TIMESTAMP\u0026quot;) .load(source_directory)) windowedCount = words.groupBy(F.window(words.timestamp, \u0026quot;10 seconds\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;5 seconds\u0026quot;, startTime=0), words.word).count() windowedQuery = windowedCount.withColumn(\u0026quot;trigger_timestamp\u0026quot;, F.expr(\u0026quot;get_current_timestamp()\u0026quot;)).writeStream\\ .trigger(processingTime=\u0026quot;5 seconds\u0026quot;)\\ .outputMode(\u0026quot;update\u0026quot;)\\ .format(\u0026quot;console\u0026quot;)\\ .option(\u0026quot;truncate\u0026quot;, False)\\ .start() streamingQuery.awaitTermination() We now test the new Spark program.\nData source and timeline visualization\nWe provide two Python programs for this exercise: a data generator and a tool for visualizing words in a timeline. Instructions to get and run these two programs are given in the activity below.\nThe data generator is our data source. It generates two words every second for a certain amount of time. Each word is saved in a separate CSV file in source directory. It also saves the list of all generated words to a summary CSV file.\nThe visualization tool takes as its input the summary CSV file written by the data generator and visualizes the words on a timeline.\nActivity\nCopy to your home directory in the local filesystem the data generator that you find at the following path /usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/structured-streaming/tempws_gen.py Start your Spark program. When running the first time, you might get some errors. Correct your code accordingly.\nIn another terminal, run the Python script tempws_gen.py. Use the following command to learn how to run this program:\npython3 tempws_gen.py --help For this exercise, do not introduce any delay (keep the default values of the parameters --delay, --mindelay, --maxdelay).\nAfter launching the data generator, you should see some output in the terminal where you launched the Spark program. Wait for the script tempws_gen.py to terminate the data generation. The output might be a bit overwhelming. Scroll up to identify the results on each micro-batch.\nIf you need to rerun the Spark program and the data generator, make sure you delete all the files in the checkpoint location and the source directory.\nWe now want to analyze the output of the program.\nThe script tempws_gen.py has generated a file gen_words.csv in your home directory. This file contains the list of all words generated with the relative timestamps. Download the file to your computer.\nDownload the visualization tool that you find at the following path:\n/usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/structured-streaming/timeline_visualization.py to your computer.\nVisualization tool\nUse the following command to learn how to run the visualization tool:\npython timeline_visualization.py --help The visualization tool displays a vertical blue bar at each trigger. To this purpose, you’ll need to pass the tool the timestamps associated to the first and last trigger and the interval (in seconds) between two consecutive triggers.\nYou can get the timestamps associated to the first and last trigger by analyzing the output of Spark. More specifically, for each micro-batch, Spark outputs the progress details of the streaming query; you’ll need to look at the timestamp associated to the first and last micro-batch.\nExercise\nExercise 4.2 Analyze the output of your Spark program and the timeline of the generated words.\nDescribe how the counts are updated by the Spark program. Solution\nUnlike the previous exercise, here the number of occurrences of each word is counted based on a time window of 10 seconds that slides every 5 seconds. Each word is associated with an event time that is used to compute the number of occurrences. The time window starts from the first trigger, say at 12:00. If a word arrives at 12:07, the count associated to this word are updated in two time windows, 12:00 - 12:10 and 12:05 - 12:15.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"96a6833d49e7a19d1120d1cc206d0e1a","permalink":"/courses/big-data-marseille/tutorials/spark-streaming/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/big-data-marseille/tutorials/spark-streaming/","section":"courses","summary":"Tutorial Structured Streaming.","tags":null,"title":"Apache Spark — Structured Streaming","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial you’ll learn:\nHow to create a conceptual schema of a database. How to draw an entity-relationship (ER) diagram. How to translate a conceptual model into a logical model. Prerequisites:\nHaving attended Lecture 1. 1 Database of a social network platform A social network platform wants to design a relational database to store information on its users. For each user, the platform keeps its nickname, that uniquely identifies the user in the platform, first and family name, geographic location (city and country) and email address; the user can register as many email addresses as s/he wishes. Any user can share content on the platform; each post is characterized by its content, date, time and, when available, the geolocation (latitude, longitude). Optionally, users can tag one or more friends in their posts.\nTwo users are linked by a friendship relationship if both agree on befriending each other; a user can also follow another user without necessarily befriending her. For any type of relationship (friendship or follower), the platform registers the date when the relationship is established.\n1.1 Exercises Exercise\nExercise 1.1 Give the conceptual schema of the database with an ER diagram.\nSolution\nExercise\nExercise 1.2 Translate the conceptual schema into a logical schema. For each table, underline the primary key and specify the foreign keys.\nSolution\nThe collection of tables is the following:\nUserAccount (nickname, first_name, last_name, city, country) Post (post_id, content, date, time, lat, long, nickname) EmailAddress (email_address, nickname) Relationship (nickname_src, nickname_dst, type, date) Tag (post_id, nickname) The foreign keys are the following:\nPost(nickname) → UserAccount(nickname).\nEmailAddress(nickname) → EmailAddress(nickname).\nRelationship(nickname_src) → UserAccount(nickname).\nRelationship(nickname_dst) → UserAccount(nickname).\nTag(post_id) → Post(post_id).\nTag(nickname) → UserAccount(nickname).\n2 Database of a banking system The following figure shows the ER diagram with the conceptual schema of a banking system database.\nFigure 2.1: The conceptual schema of the bank database Each bank is identified by a unique code and name, and has one or several branches. A branch is responsible for opening accounts and granting loans to customers. Each account is identified by a number (acct_nbr) and is either a checking or savings account (property acct_type). Each customer is identified by its social security number (ssn); a customer can be granted several loans and open as many accounts as s/he wishes.\n2.1 Exercises Exercise\nExercise 2.1 Which primary key would you choose for the entity Bank? Justify your answer. Solution\nSince no two banks have the same code_bank or name, either property can be chosen as the primary key of the entity Bank. Both can be considered as valid candidate keys.\nExercise\nExercise 2.2 Would you consider {code_bank, name} as a valid candidate key for the entity Bank? Justify your answer. Solution\nThe answer is no. While there aren’t any banks that have the same value for {code_bank, name}, two subsets ({code_bank} and {name}) are candidate keys.\nExercise\nExercise 2.3 Complete the diagram in the figure by adding the cardinalities to the relations. Justify your choices when any ambiguity arises. Solution\nExercise\nExercise 2.4 Translate the conceptual schema into a logical schema.

The dealership sells both new and used cars, and it operates a service facility. The database should keep data about the cars (serial number, make, model, colour, whether it is new or used), the salespeople (first and family name) and the customers (first and family name, phone number, address). Also, the following business rules hold:\nA salesperson may sell many cars, but each car is sold by only one salesperson. A customer may buy many cars, but each car is bought by only one customer. A salesperson writes a single invoice for each car s/he sells. The invoice is identified by a number and indicates the sale date and the price. A customer gets an invoice for each car s/he buys. When a customer takes one or more cars in for repair, one service ticket is written for each car. The ticket is identified by a number and indicates the date on which the car is received from the customer, as well as the date on which the car should be returned to the customer. A car brought in for service can be worked on by many mechanics, and each mechanic may work on many cars.\n3.1 Exercises Exercise\nExercise 3.1 Give the conceptual schema of the database with an ER diagram.

How to define and build images. How to create and use volumes. How to define and use networks. Prerequisites:\nHaving installed Docker on your computer or having imported the Linux virtual machine either with VirtualBox or with Multipass. Using a virtual machine with Multipass? Click here for more info\nMultipass commands\nTo start the virtual machine, type multipass start cloudvm.\nThe folder /home/ubuntu/labs in the virtual machine is mounted (i.e., linked) to the folder on YOUR computer (let’s call it LAB) where you’ll store all your lab material. You specified this folder when you installed the virtual machine.\nIf you don’t remember the path to the folder linked to /home/ubuntu/labs, type the command multipass info cloudvm.\nTo open a terminal into the virtual machine, type multipass shell cloudvm.\nWhen the terminal opens, the current working directory is /home/ubuntu.\nType cd labs to move to the folder where you’ll find your lab material.\nYou’ll use the virtual machine terminal only to type the Docker commands. You can use all the tools installed on your machine to create and manage the files in the directory LAB directly from your computer.\nOnce the lab is over, type exit to leave the virtual machine terminal. This will lead you back to the terminal of your computer.\nIn the terminal of your computer, type multipass stop cloudvm to stop the virtual machine. This will NOT destroy your files! It just stops the virtual machine from needlessly using the resources of your computer.\nBeing familiar with the notions of containers, images, volumes and networks in Docker. See the Lecture 2 for an introduction. Being familiar with the basic notions of Linux. Don’t hesitate to look at the Docker cheat sheet to verify the syntax of the Docker commands. Terminology\nYou’ll use the terminal to run Docker commands. Referring to the Docker architecture, the terminal is the client that communicates with the Docker daemon.\nDocker runs containers on your computer. We’ll refer to your computer as the host, the containers being the guests.\nA containerized application is an application running in a container. 1 Running containers We now learn how to use the command docker run and some of its options. In the following exercises, we’ll run containers from the image named alpine that is available on the DockerHub registry. This image provides a lightweight distribution (i.e., it doesn’t contain many features) of Linux.\nExercise\nExercise 1.1 You want to run the container from the latest version of the image alpine. Which command would you write in the terminal? Execute it. Exercise\nExercise 1.2 Is the container still running? Exercise\nExercise 1.3 By looking at the command executed within the container (/bin/sh), can you tell why the container stopped without giving any output? We’re now going to do something useful with the image alpine. Make sure you read the good practices that you should adopt while playing with images and containers.\nGood practices\nName your containers. Although Docker assigns a default name to a new container, it’s usually a good practice to give a container a name of your choice to make it easily distinguishable. You can do it by using the option --name. Try the following: docker run --name my-alpine alpine\nAs before, the container stops immediately. If you list all your containers by typing again:\ndocker container ls -a\nyou should see a container named my-alpine.\nRemove automatically a container if you use it once. Unless you want to reuse your container later, you can ask Docker to automatically remove it when it stops by using the option --rm. This will prevent unused containers from taking up too much disk space. Try the following:\ndocker run --rm --name container-to-remove alpine\nIf you list all the containers you should see that there is no container named container-to-remove.\nRemove unused containers. Stopped containers that have been run without using the option --rm are still stored in the host. If you want to remove a specific container (e.g., my-alpine), use the following command: docker container rm my-alpine\nIf you want to remove all stopped containers, use the following command:\ndocker container prune\nRemove unused images. Images can take up a lot of disk space. As a result, you should remember to remove those that you don’t intend to use any longer. The commands to remove a specific image and prune unused ones are docker image rm and docker image prune -a respectively. 1.1 Pass a command to the containerized application Remember that the template of docker run is the following:\ndocker run [options] image-name [command] [arg]\nThe optional parameter command refers to a command that you can pass the containerized application, possibly with some arguments (parameter arg).\nLet’s see an example. As we saw before, when we run a container from the image alpine, a Linux terminal /bin/sh is launched.\nNotice\nThe Linux terminal /bin/sh is run within the container. Henceforth, we’ll use the following terms:\nHost terminal. The terminal that you use to interact with the operating system of your computer. Guest terminal. The terminal that is run within the container. By using the optional parameter command, we can run a command in the guest terminal.\nExercise\nExercise 1.4 Run a container from the image alpine and execute the Linux command ls that lists the content of the current directory.\nWhere are the listed files stored? In the host or in the container? Notice\nIn Exercise 1.4 the command ls is executed in the guest terminal, but its output is redirected to the host terminal.\nIn other words, when we run the container, we don’t interact directly with the guest terminal; we just send a command and the output is redirected to the host terminal.\nNow let’s see how to execute a command in the guest terminal that also requires an argument.\nExercise\nExercise 1.5 By using the Linux utility ping, check whether the Web site www.centralesupelec.fr is reachable. Now run the following command:\ndocker run --name my-alpine -it alpine\nNote: we didn’t use the option --rm (the container will not be removed when we stop it, we’re going to use it again). Moreover, we didn’t specify any command to run in the guest terminal.\nExercise\nExercise 1.6 What do you obtain? 1.2 Starting and stopping containers. docker run is a shorthand for two Docker commands, namely docker create, that creates a container from an image, and docker start, that starts the container after its creation.\nSuppose now that you want to download a Web page by using Linux Alpine. You can use the Linux command wget followed by the URL of the page that you want to download.\nExercise\nExercise 1.7 By using the guest terminal in the container my-alpine, download this Web page.\nWhere will the Web page be saved? The host computer or the container? Want to copy the donwloaded file from the container to your computer?\nTo copy the file presentation to your working directory, type the following command in the host terminal:\ndocker cp \u0026lt;containerId\u0026gt;:/presentation . In the previous command, replace \u0026lt;containerId\u0026gt; with the identifier of your container. You can obtain the identifier of the container from the output of the command docker container ls -a.\nWhere are the containers and image files stored?\nIf you use MacOS or Windows\nThe files managed by Docker are not stored directly in your computer, but in the Linux virtual machine installed and operated by Docker Desktop (remember, Docker always need Linux to be executed).\nTherefore, you need to open a terminal inside that Linux virtual machine by typing the following command:\ndocker run -it --rm --privileged --pid=host justincormack/nsenter1 Once the terminal is opened, you can follow the instructions given below for Linux users.\nIf you use Docker on Linux\nAll files managed by Docker are stored under folder /var/lib/docker.\nTo access that folder, you need to be root (i.e., administrator). Type the command sudo su.\nIf you type ls /var/lib/docker you can look at the folders stored under this directory. You’ll see that there are folders corresponding to the different objects managed by Docker (containers, images, volumes and networks).\nTo locate the files of a specific container, you first need to get the container identifier by typing docker container ls -a.\nType the command docker inspect \u0026lt;container-id\u0026gt; (replace \u0026lt;container-id\u0026gt; with the identifier of the container that you intend to inspect).\nLocate the field UpperDir. The value of this field is the path to the directory (let’s call it CONTAINER_DIR) that contains the upper layer of the container (the writable layer). It should be a path that ends by /diff.\nIf you type cd CONTAINER_DIR (replace CONTAINER_DIR with the value of the field UpperDir) you can finally see the files stored in your container.\nIn my-alpine guest terminal type exit. This closes the guest terminal and, as a result, stops the container.\nNOTICE\nStopping the container will not erase any of the files stored in the container. Removing the container will.\nIf you want to start the container my-alpine again, you can use the following command:\ndocker container start -ai my-alpine\nThis will open the guest terminal of the container again; type ls to verify that the Web page that you downloaded before is still there.\nHomework (optional)\nSuppose that you need to download all the figures of this Web page. The Linux utility wget comes in handy. However, you don’t have Linux and you’d like to avoid the hassle of installing it on your computer, or in a virtual machine, just for this task.\nA great alternative is to run Linux in a Docker container. Unfortunately, the Alpine distribution that we’ve been playing with doesn’t provide an implementation of wget with all the options that we need.\nWe turn to another Linux distribution, Ubuntu, for which DockerHub has several images.\nExercise\nExercise 1.8 Run a container with Ubuntu (latest) and open a guest terminal. Call the container dl-figures, and avoid the option --rm, we’ll use this container later. From now on, we’ll be interacting with the guest Ubuntu terminal. If you type the command wget, you’ll get an error (bash: wget: command not found).\nNotice\nThe image Ubuntu doesn’t include all the commands that you’d find in a full-blown Ubuntu distribution; the reason is to keep the size of the image small, a necessary constraint given that images are transferred over the Internet.\nLuckily, there’s a way to install wget in our Ubuntu distribution. Ubuntu provides a powerful command-line package manager called Advanced Package Tool (APT). First, you need to run the following command:\napt update\nwhich fetches the available packages from a list of sources available in file /etc/apt/sources.list.\nThen, you can install wget by running the following command:\napt install -y wget\nIn order to obtain all the figures from a Web page, type the following command:\nwget -nd -H -p -P /my-figures -A jpg,jpeg,png,gif -e robots=off -w 0.5 https://www.centralesupelec.fr/fr/presentation You should see in the current directory a new folder named my-figures containing the downloaded figures; verify it by typing ls my-figures.\nBefore terminating, don’t forget to read your fortune cookie. In the shell, run the following command:\napt-get install -y fortune\nand then:\n/usr/games/fortune -s\nWhen you’re done, you can simply type the command exit to quit the guest terminal and stop the container.\n2 Creating Images A Docker image can be thought of as a template to create and run a container. An image is a file that contains a layered filesystem with each layer being immutable; this means that the files that belong to a layer cannot be modified or deleted, nor can files be added to a layer.\nWhen a container is created from an image, it will be composed of all the image read-only layers and, on top of them, a writable layer (termed the container layer), where all the new files created in the container will be written. For example, the Web page that you downloaded in Exercise 1.7 were stored in the writable layer of that container (cf Slide 64).\n2.1 Dockerfiles The most common way to create an image is to use a Dockerfile, a text file that contains all the instructions necessary to build the image. The advantage of the Dockerfile is that it can be interpreted by the Docker engine, which makes the creation of images an automated and repeatable task.\nSuppose that we want to create a containerized application to download figures from a Web page. As a template for this application, we need to build a new image, that we’ll call fig-downloader.\nThe Dockerfile containing the instructions to build the image fig-downloader is as follows:\nFROM ubuntu RUN apt-get update RUN apt-get install -y wget RUN mkdir -p /my-figures WORKDIR /my-figures ENTRYPOINT [\u0026quot;wget\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-nd\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-r\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-A\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;jpg,jpeg,bmp,png,gif\u0026quot;] CMD [\u0026quot;https://www.centralesupelec.fr/fr/presentation\u0026quot;] Here’s the explanation:\nWe use the image ubuntu as the base image. This corresponds to the instruction FROM ubuntu.\nWe install the utility wget in the base image. This corresponds to the instructions RUN apt-get update and RUN apt-get install -y wget.\nWe create a directory my-figures under the root directory of the image. This corresponds to the instruction RUN mkdir -p /my-figures.\nWe set the newly created directory /my-figures as the working directory of the image. This corresponds to the instruction WORKDIR /my-figures.\nWe specify the command to be executed when a container is run from this image. This corresponds to the instruction\nENTRYPOINT [\u0026quot;wget\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-nd\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-r\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-A\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;jpg,jpeg,bmp,png,gif\u0026quot;]\nThis instruction means: execute wget with the options -nd, -r, -A; the last option takes a list of file extensions (jpg,jpeg,bmp,png,gif) as its argument.\nRemember that the utility wget takes the URL of the Web page as an argument. The URL will be specified when we run the container from the image fig-downloader. Optionally, we can specify a default argument by using the keyword CMD. The meaning of the instruction: CMD [\u0026quot;https://www.centralesupelec.fr/fr/presentation\u0026quot;]\nis: if we don’t give any URL when we run the container, the figures will be downloaded from https://www.centralesupelec.fr/fr/presentation.\nExercise\nExercise 2.1 What’s the relation between the Dockerfile lines and the image layers? Exercise\nExercise 2.2 Could you identify a problem in this Dockerfile? Modify the Dockerfile accordingly. 2.2 Building an image We’re now going to build an image from a Dockerfile.\nCreate a directory named fig-downloader in your computer with a file named Dockerfile inside.\nIn the Dockerfile write the set of instructions that you proposed in Exercise 2.2.\nIn the terminal, set the working directory to fig-downloader.\nBuild an image called fig-downloader by executing the following command:\ndocker build -t fig-downloader .\nThe . at the end of the command means that the Docker engine will look for a file named Dockerfile in the working directory.\nGood to know\nIf you give the Dockerfile a different name (say, Dockerfile-fig-downloader), the command to build the image will be:\ndocker build -t fig-downloader -f Dockerfile-fig-downloader .\nThe option -f is used to specify the name of the Dockerfile.\nIn order to verify that the new image has been created, type the following command:\ndocker images\nExercise\nExercise 2.3 Run the following command:\ndocker run --name dl-1 fig-downloader\nWhat does it do? Where are the downloaded pictures? Exercise\nExercise 2.4 Run the following command:\ndocker run --name dl-2 fig-downloader https://www.centralesupelec.fr/ What does it do? Where are the downloaded pictures? 2.3 Containerized Python application Download this archive file and unzip it into your working directory. In this archive you’ll find:\nA Dockerfile. A Python script main.py that asks the user to enter the URL and the language of a Web page, and prints the 10 most frequent words occurring in that page. A file requirements.txt with the list of the Python packages needed to run the given script. The content of the Dockerfile is as follows:\nFROM python:3.7-slim RUN mkdir -p /app WORKDIR /app COPY ./main.py ./requirements.txt /app/ RUN pip install -r requirements.txt ENTRYPOINT [\u0026quot;python\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;main.py\u0026quot;] Exercise\nExercise 2.5 Describe what this Dockerfile does. Exercise\nExercise 2.6 Build an image called wordfreq from this Dockerfile. Exercise\nExercise 2.7 Without changing the Dockerfile, rebuild the same image. What do you notice? Exercise\nExercise 2.8 What happens if you modify a line in the Python script and you rebuild the image? Exercise\nExercise 2.9 Based on the previous considerations, can you tell what’s wrong with this Dockerfile? Modify the Dockerfile accordingly and rebuild the image. Exercise\nExercise 2.10 Modify main.py by adding a new line of code and rebuild the image. What changed? Play with the application by running the following command:\ndocker run --rm -it wordfreq\nThe containerized application will prompt you to insert the URL of a webpage and the language of the page (in English). The output will be the 20 most used words in the webpage.\n3 Data Volumes In Exercise 2.3 you’ve been asked to run a container named dl-1 to download some figures from a Web page. The figures were downloaded into the directory /my-figures of the container. But we left a question unanswered.\nHow do we transfer those figures from the container to the host computer?\nThe solution is to use volumes.\n3.1 Docker volumes A volume can be seen as a virtual storage device attached to a container. All files there are written to a volume survive the containerized application that created them. In other words, when a container is destroyed, all the files created by the application in the container remain in the volume.\nLet’s create a new Docker volume called data-volume:\ndocker volume create data-volume\nGood to know (advanced notion)\nWhere the data will be actually stored?\nYou can inspect the new volume by typing the following command:\ndocker volume inspect data-volume\nA mount point is indicated; that’s the folder where the data will be actually stored. If your computer runs Linux, that folder will be available on the host; if your computer runs Windows or MacOS, you’ll not find that folder on your computer. Instead, it will be available in the virtual machine that Docker use on MacOS and Windows.\nDo you want to see the directory? (Instructions for Windows and MacOS)\nOne way to look into the hidden VM is to run the following containerized application:\ndocker run -it --rm --privileged --pid=host justincormack/nsenter1\nThis application will open a guest terminal into the VM. You can then use the commands cd and ls to browse to the directory indicated as the mount path of the new volume.\n3.1.1 Sharing data A Docker volume can be used to share data between containers.\nExercise\nExercise 3.1 Run a container from the image ubuntu, specifying the options to:\nRemove the container once its execution is over.\nInteract with the guest Linux terminal in the container.\nMount the volume data-volume at the container’s directory /data. Feel free to use the Docker cheat sheet.\nType the following command in the guest Linux terminal to create a file test-file.txt in the directory /data: echo \u0026quot;This is a new file\u0026quot; \u0026gt; /data/test-file.txt\nPrint to the console the content of the file with the following command: cat /data/test-file.txt\nType exit to leave the guest terminal. Since we’ve specified the option --rm, the container is destroyed. Now we’re going to verify that test-file.txt is still accessible. Exercise\nExercise 3.2 Run a container from the image alpine:latest, specifying the options to:\nRemove the container once its execution is over.\nInteract with the guest Linux terminal in the container.\nMount the volume data-volume to the directory /my-data of the container. Exercise\nExercise 3.3 Verify that you can read the file test-file.txt. Which folder would you look in? Type exit to exit the guest terminal and terminate the container.\n4 Single-Host Networking In order to let containers communicate and, therefore, co-operate, Docker defines a simple networking model known as the container network model\nIf you use a Linux virtual machine with Multipass In this section, you’ll need to open several terminals in the virtual machine. You can do it easily by using byobu, an advanced window manager already available in your virtual machine.\nJust type byobu to launch the window manager.\nIf you want to open a new terminal, just press F2.\nIf you want to switch from a terminal to another, just press F3 (to move to previous terminal) or F4 (to move to next terminal).\nIf you want to close a terminal, just type exit.\nWhen you close all terminals, byobu will stop executing.\nExercise\nExercise 4.1 Describe the output of the following command:\ndocker network ls\nExercise\nExercise 4.2 The following command:\ndocker network inspect bridge\noutputs the configuration of the network bridge. By looking at this configuration, can you tell what IP addresses will be given to the containers attached to this network? What’s the IP address of the router of this network? 4.1 Creating networks By default, any new container is attached to the network named bridge.\nExercise 4.3 Explain why it is not a good practice to attach all our containers to the same network.\nIn order to create a new network, you can use the following command:\ndocker network create network_name\nExercise\nExercise 4.4 Create two networks named buckingham and rochefort that use the driver bridge. By using the docker network inspect command, look at the IP addresses of the new networks and write them down. Exercise\nExercise 4.5 Create three containers athos, porthos and aramis and attach them to the two networks buckingham and rochefort as displayed in this figure. The three containers will open a Linux Alpine shell. You’ll need to launch the commands in three separate tabs of your terminal window.\nWhat will the IP addresses of the three containers be in the two networks? Remember that porthos is attached to two networks, therefore it’ll have two network interfaces (endpoints) and, as a result, two IP addresses. Verify your answers by inspecting the two networks (use the command docker network inspect). 4.2 Communication between containers Let’s see if and when the three containers can communicate.\nExercise\nExercise 4.6 Which containers are able to communicate? Justify your answer. Exercise\nExercise 4.7 Try to ping porthos from athos by using its IP address.\nWhich IP address of porthos would you use? Exercise\nExercise 4.8 Try to ping porthos from athos by using its name. Do you succeed? Are you surprised? You can now exit the three containers.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a74fda64fd4d3f15083e937e46612453","permalink":"/courses/cloud-computing/tutorials/tutorial-docker/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/cloud-computing/tutorials/tutorial-docker/","section":"courses","summary":"Text of the lab assignment on Docker","tags":null,"title":"Getting started with Docker","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Warning\nIf you use the Linux VM, you need to change the hardware configuration of the VM before booting it. You can also watch this video. Here are the necessary modifications:\nIncrease the main memory to 4GB.\nSet the number of CPUs to 2.\nWithout these modifications you’re not going to have a good experience with Kubernetes.\nIn this tutorial you’ll learn:\nHow to build and deploy a multi-service application with Docker Compose.\nHow to push an image to DockerHub.\nHow to deploy a multi-service application with Kubernetes.\nWarning\nThis tutorial is adapted from the examples presented in Chapters 14 and 20 of the book G. Schenker, Learn Docker - Fundamentals of Docker 19.x (March 2020).\n1 Docker Compose In this section, you’re going to build and deploy a multi-service application by using Docker Compose.\nDownload this archive file and unzip it into a folder on your own computer. The archive contains all the necessary files to build and run a web application consisting of two services:\nweb. This is the frontend (the part the user interacts with) of the application. It consists of HTML and JavaScript code.\ndb. This is the backend (the part hidden to the user). It is a PostgreSQL (relational) database.\nThe structure of the application is shown in Figure 1.1. The root directory of the application contains two subdirectories, one for each service (database and web).\nFigure 1.1: Structure of the application Good to know\nThe files with extension .conf under the directory database contain configuration parameters of the PostgreSQL database.\nThe file init-db.sql under the directory database contains the SQL queries to populate the database with some data (photos of cats).\nThe directory web contains the HTML and JavaScript code of the web application. The file package.json contains the dependencies to install.\nBoth directories contain a Dockerfile. The one in directory database is as follows:\nFROM postgres:10.2-alpine COPY init-db.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ RUN chown postgres:postgres /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/*.sql ENV POSTGRES_USER dockeruser ENV POSTGRES_PASSWORD dockerpass ENV POSTGRES_DB pets The Dockerfile builds on an existing image called postgres:10-2-alpine, that is documented here.\nExercise\nExercise 1.1 Consider the following line in the Dockerfile:\nCOPY init-db.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/\nBy looking at the documentation of the image postgres:10-2-alpine, answer the two following questions:\nWhere is the directory /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/?\nWhy do we copy the file init-db.sql to this directory?\nThe last three lines of the Dockerfile contain a keyword (ENV) that we never came across before.\nExercise\nExercise 1.2 Look again at the documentation of the image postgres:10-2-alpine and try to explain the meaning of the last three lines of the Dockerfile.\nThe Dockerfile of the web application is as follows:\nFROM node:9.6-alpine RUN mkdir /app WORKDIR /app COPY package.json /app/ RUN npm install COPY ./src /app/src EXPOSE 3000 CMD node src/server.js The Dockerfile builds on the image node:9.6-alpine that contains a Node.js environment, a JavaScript-based platform for server-side applications. The instructions in the Dockerfile look like the ones of the examples that we’ve seen in the first tutorial and in the lectures.\nGood to know\nThe command npm install installs all the dependencies specified in the file package.json from the software registry npm.\nThe instruction EXPOSE 3000 informs that the container listens on port 3000 when it is executed from the image.\nFrom the Docker documentation we learn that the “EXPOSE instruction does not actually publish the port. It functions as a type of documentation between the person who builds the image and the person who runs the container, about which ports are intended to be published”.\nIn order to actually publish the port, we’ll use the file docker-compose.yml.\n1.1 Describing the application The application showcases a building block of a pet store. In the current version, the application shows a few pictures of cats.\nThe root directory of the application contains a file named docker-compose.yml that contains the declarative configuration of the application. The content of the file is as follows. It is a sequence of key-value pairs.\nversion: \u0026quot;3.6\u0026quot; services: web: build: web image: pet-store-web networks: - backend ports: - 5000:3000 db: build: database image: pet-store-db networks: - backend volumes: - pets-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data networks: backend: volumes: pets-data: There are three main sections:\nservices. Defines the services of the application. Here two services are defined: web and db.\nnetworks. Defines the networks used by the application. Here one network is defined: backend.\nvolumes. Defines the volumes used by the application. Here one volume is defined: pets-data. The volume is attached to the directory /var/lib/postgresql/data (that is in the container).\nExercise\nExercise 1.3 What key informs docker compose where to find the Dockerfile of the two services?\nWhen we’ll build the application from the file docker-compose.yml, two images will be created, one for each service.\nExercise\nExercise 1.4 What will the name of the two images be? What key in the file docker-compose.yml gives you this information?\n1.2 Building the application We now build the application.\nOpen the command-line terminal and by using the command cd position yourself in the root directory pet-store of the application.\nExecute the following command:\ndocker-compose build\nDuring the build you might get a npm warning. Just ignore it.\nWhen the build is complete, verify that the two images corresponding to the two services have been created (which docker command do you need here?).\n1.3 Executing the application We now execute the application with the following command:\nIf you use a Linux virtual machine with Multipass In this section, you’ll need to open several terminals in the virtual machine. You can do it easily by using byobu, an advanced window manager already available in your virtual machine.\nJust type byobu to launch the window manager.\nIf you want to open a new terminal, just press F2.\nIf you want to switch from a terminal to another, just press F3 (to move to previous terminal) or F4 (to move to next terminal).\nIf you want to close a terminal, just type exit.\nWhen you close all terminals, byobu will stop executing.\ndocker-compose up\nThe execution of the command will print a series of messages on screen. The terminal should hang when the messages stop (the last message should be database system is ready to accept connections).\nTake no action on the screen and open a new terminal or a new tab in the current terminal window.\nExercise\nExercise 1.5 Verify that the network and the volumes associated with the application have been correctly created.\nExercise\nExercise 1.6 How many containers do you expect to be associated to the application?\nYou can verify the answer to the previous question by typing the following command:\ndocker-compose ps\nThis command is exactly equivalent to docker container ls, except that it only shows the containers associated with the application that we’ve just executed.\nExercise\nExercise 1.7 In the output of the command docker-compose ps, can you explain the meaning of the following?\n0.0.0.0:5000-\u0026gt;3000/tcp\nExercise\nExercise 1.8 Can you tell which URL you have to type in your web browser to access the application?\nIf you use a Linux virtual machine with Multipass\nIn order to open a Web browser window in the VM, you need to open a new terminal window on your computer and follow these instructions:\nType multipass ls to list all the virtual machines managed by Multipass.\nCopy the first IP address associated to the virtual machine cloudvm.\nType the following command:\nxpra start ssh://ubuntu@ip/ --start=firefox where you’ll replace ip with the IP address that you copied above.\nA Firefox window should appear. Warning\nIf you want to see the cats, you need to append /pet to the URL that you found in the previous question. This is determined in file server.js.\n1.4 Shutting down the application You can shut down the application by typing the following command:\ndocker-compose down\nExercise\nExercise 1.9 Does shutting down the application remove the networks created for the application? What about the volumes?\n1.5 Scaling a service When we launch the application, we can specify the number of instances of each service. This is useful when we expect our application to be solicited by many users; the workload will be automatically balanced across all the instances of the service.\nLet’s launch our application with 3 instances of the service web:\ndocker-compose up --scale web=3 -d\nExercise\nExercise 1.10 Running the previous command results in an error.\nCan you explain why?\nWhat fix would you propose in file docker-compose.yml? Warning\nYou need to shut down the application before relaunching it again. In fact, even if we got an error, an instance of the db service and an instance of the service web are still running.\nModify the file docker-compose.yml and relaunch the application.\nRun the following command and verify that you actually have three running instances of the service web.\ndocker-compose ps\nTry to connect to the application by using the three port numbers indicated in the output of the previous command. Warning\nDon’t forget to shut down the application before you go on.\n2 Pushing an application Once we have built an application, we might want to share it by pushing it to the DockerHub registry or any other container registry, be it private or public.\n2.1 Creating an account on DockerHub You need to create an account on the DockerHub website in order to perform this activity.\n2.2 Renaming the images In order to push your images to the registry, you need to rename them, so as the new name has the following structure:\nyourusername/image-name:image-tag\nFor instance, since my username is quercinigia, I’ll rename the two images pet-store-web and pet-store-db with the docker tag command as follows:\ndocker tag pet-store-web quercinigia/pet-store-web:1.0\ndocker tag pet-store-db quercinigia/pet-store-db:1.0\nI chosen 1.0 as a tag, but feel free to pick another one.\n2.3 Logging in You need to log in to your DockerHub account.\nInstructions for Docker Desktop (macOS and Windows)\nmacOS users: to see how to log in click here.\nWindows users: to see how to log in click here.\nInstructions for the Linux VM\nLog in to DockerHub by typing the following command in the terminal (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual username).\ndocker login -u YOUR-USERNAME\nWarning\nYou might get a warning that your password will be stored unencrypted. There are methods to prevent this from happening. These methods being out of the scope of this course, the interested reader can look them up at this link.\n2.4 Pushing the images Once you’re successfully logged in, you can type the following commands in the terminal to push the two images of your application:\ndocker push YOUR-USERNAME/pet-store-web:1.0\ndocker push YOUR-USERNAME/pet-store-db:1.0\nRemember to replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual username in the commands above.\nAfter the task is completed, verify that the images appear in your Docker registry.\nGood to know\nHere we manually tagged and uploaded the two images. This method becomes quickly annoying when the application consists of more than two images. Another way to go about this task is:\nSpecify the image names with your username in file docker-compose.yml. For instance, in my docker-compose.yml I would write: services: web: build: web image: quercinigia/pet-store-web:1.0 ... db: build: database image: quercinigia/pet-store-db:1.0 ... Build the application with the following command: docker-compose build\nPush the images of the application with the following command: docker-compose push\nThis way, with just two commands we push to the registry all the images of the application, no matter how many they are.\n3 Introduction to Kubernetes Kubernetes is the most popular orchestrator to date. It is used to manage a multi-service application, usually deployed across multiple hosts in a cluster.\nWhile using Docker Compose, a service corresponds to a Docker image and a service instance to a Docker container.\nAs opposed to that, in Kubernetes the computation unit is a pod, that is a collection of containers. In other words, we don’t reason in terms of containers anymore, but in terms of pods. Of course, a pod can also consist of just one container.\nGood to know\nIn practice, we rarely have to manipulate pods directly in Kubernetes, as there are higher-level objects that manage them. We’ll use these objects in the next sections.\n3.1 Activate Kubernetes Instructions for Docker Desktop (macOS and Windows)\nYou need to follow all the instructions documented on this page\nBefore moving on, don’t forget to type the following command to verify that Kubernetes is correctly activated\nkubectl get nodes\nBefore moving on, don’t forget to type the following command to verify that Kubernetes is correctly activated\nkubectl get nodes\nYou should see a node called docker-desktop whose status is set to READY. If the status is NOT READY, just wait few seconds before typing the command again.\nWarning\nThis solution might not be working for you. In that case, disable Kubernetes in Docker Desktop and install minikube, by following these instructions.\nInstructions for the Linux VM\nIn the Linux VM you’ll find Minikube, a single-node Kubernetes cluster in VirtualBox. Please follow all the instructions:\nStart the cluster, type the following command: minikube start\nVerify that Kubernetes is correctly activated by typing the following command: kubectl get nodes\nYou should see a node called minikube whose status is set to READY. If the status is NOT READY, just wait few seconds before typing the command again.\nOpen a new terminal and type the command: minikube tunnel\nWhen prompted to enter a password, just type ENTER. The command will start to produce some output. Leave that terminal open and go back to the previous terminal.\nTunnel\nThe Minikube tunnel is used to create a route to services deployed with type LoadBalancer. If you don’t activate the tunnel, you won’t be able to use these services in the exercises below.\n3.2 Deploying a pod In order to deploy a pod, we first have to give its specification, basically its name and the containers that compose it with their settings. Similarly to Docker Compose, a pod is specified in a declarative way with a YAML configuration file.\nConsider the following specification.\napiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: web-pod labels: app: web-pod spec: containers: - name: web image: nginx:alpine ports: - containerPort: 80 Here is an explanation of the properties in the specification.\napiVersion. Defines the versioned schema of this representation.\nkind. The type of the resource that we intend to create.\nmetadata. The resource metadata. The list of all metadata is specified here.\nspec. The specification of the desired behaviour of the pod. The list of the possible specifications can be found here.\nEssentially, the previous specification defines a pod with a container that is launched from the image nginx:alpine (a Web server) and listens to ports 80 and 443.\nActivity\nCopy the previous specification to a file named sample-pod.yaml (or any other name of your liking).\nBy using the command cd in the terminal, place yourself in the directory where the file sample-pod.yaml is stored.\nDeploy the pod by typing the following command:\nkubectl create -f sample-pod.yaml\nVerify that the pod is deployed by typing the following command: kubectl get pods\nThe first time you run the last command, you might see that the pod is not ready yet. You need to wait for the image nginx:alpine to be pulled from DockerHub. Wait few seconds and try the command again until the pod is marked as running.\nYou can also get more information on the running pod (e.g., its assigned IP address) by typing the following command:\nkubectl get pod -o wide web-pod\nExercise\nExercise 3.1 Open a web browser and type http://localhost:80.\nWhat do you get? What if you try to use the IP of the pod instead of locahost?\nWhat should we define in order to fix the problem? The following configuration defines a Service object of type LoadBalancer:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: nginx-service spec: type: LoadBalancer ports: - port: 8080 targetPort: 80 protocol: TCP name: http selector: app: web-pod Good to know\nA LoadBalancer service is a NodePort service (cf slides 64-65 in Lecture 3) that offers load balancing capabilities. It is intended to expose an IP address that client applications (external to the Kubernetes cluster) can use to access the service.\nExercise\nExercise 3.2 What is the field selector in the definition of the service? (cf slide 56-57 in Lecture 3)\nExercise\nExercise 3.3 In the specification of the service, what port and targetPort mean?\nActivity\nCopy and paste the service specification into a file named sample-service.yaml (or any other name of your liking).\nBy using the command cd in the terminal, place yourself in the directory where the file sample-service.yaml is stored.\nDeploy the service by typing the following command:\nkubectl create -f sample-service.yaml\nVerify that the service is deployed by typing the following command: kubectl get services\nThis command returns all services running in Kubernetes. For each service, you also get a name. In order to only target the service that you’ve just created, simply type the following command:\nkubectl get svc/nginx-service\nYour service’s name is nginx-service (as specified in file sample-service.yml); svc is only the namespace where all Kubernetes services are put.\nExercise\nExercise 3.4 By looking at the output of the command kubectl get svc/nginx-service, which URL do you need to type in the Web browser in order to access the service?\nWarning\nStop the pod and the service before moving on. Here are the commands to do so:\nkubectl delete po/web-pod\nkubectl delete svc/nginx-service\n4 Kubernetes: deploying an application In this section, we’re going to deploy our pet store in Kubernetes. As a reminder, our application consists of two services: web and db.\nIn order to define an application in Kubernetes, we need to use two types of objects for each service of the application:\nA workload resource that gives the specification of the service, such as the pods that make up the service itself (images, network settings) and metadata, such as the desired number of instances.\nA Service object. As we have seen previously, a service object exposes an IP address that allows client applications, both inside and outside the Kubernetes cluster, to connect to the service.\nWhen we define an application in Kubernetes, we rarely, if ever, need to play directly with pods. Instead, we can resort to higher-level objects, called Controllers, for an easier definition of the desired state of the application itself. The type of the controller that we need to use depends on the nature of the service itself: stateless or stateful (slides 16 of Lecture 3.).\nExercise\nExercise 4.1 Is the service web of our application stateless or stateful?\nIs the service db of our application stateless of stateful? 4.1 The web service: deployment For stateless application services, we can use a Deployment for the deployment of a set of identical pods that are launched across several nodes in the Kubernetes cluster.\nDeployment and ReplicaSet\nDeployments and ReplicaSets have been introduced in slides 51-52-53 of the third lecture.\nWe here define the specification of a Deployment corresponding to the service web.\napiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: web spec: replicas: 3 selector: matchLabels: app: pets service: web template: metadata: labels: app: pets service: web spec: containers: - image: quercinigia/pet-store-web:1.0 name: web ports: - containerPort: 3000 protocol: TCP Here is the explanation of the specification:\nA Deployment named web is created, as indicated by the field metadata.name.\nThe Deployment creates three replicated pods, as indicated by the field spec.replicas.\nThe Deployment considers that the pods with both labels app: pets and service: web are part of the deployment. This is indicated by the field spec.selector.matchLabels. This field is used to let the Deployment know how to find its pods.\nThe configuration of the pods that are part of the Deployment is given in the field spec.template and its subfields.\nEach pod of the Deployment is given labels app: pets and service: web. This is indicated by the field spec.template.metadata.labels. Note that here we specify exactly the same values as in spec.selector.matchLabels. This field is used to give pods labels so that they can be identified and located in Kubernetes.\nEach pod has exactly one container, named web, run from the image quercinigia/pet-store-web:1.0 stored in the DockerHub. The container listens on port 3000 and uses the TCP protocol. This is specified in the field spec.template.spec.containers.\nActivity\nCopy and paste the previous specification to a new file web-deployment.yaml (or any name of your liking). Make sure that you replace the image quercinigia/pet-store-web:1.0 with the one that you pushed to your DockerHub registry.\nUse the command cd in the terminal to position yourself in the directory where the file web-deployment.yaml is stored.\nDeploy this Deployment in Kubernetes by typing the following command:\nkubectl create -f web-deployment.yaml\nExercise\nExercise 4.2 Type the following command:\nkubectl get all\nWhich objects have been created following the creation of the Deployment?\nExercise\nExercise 4.3 Get the name of one of the running pods and kill it by using the following command\nkubectl delete name-of-pod\nIf the command hangs in the terminal, feel free to type Ctrl-C to get back control of the terminal.\nType again following command:\nkubectl get all\nHow many pods do you see? Is it surprising?\n4.2 The web service: service Now we need to define a Service in order to expose the web service to the public. Here is the definition:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: web spec: type: LoadBalancer ports: - port: 8080 targetPort: 3000 protocol: TCP selector: app: pets service: web Exercise\nExercise 4.4 Describe the specification of this service.\nActivity\nCopy and paste the previous specification to a new file web-service.yaml (or any name of your liking).\nUse the command cd in the terminal to position yourself in the directory where the file web-service.yaml is stored.\nCreate the service with the following command:\nkubectl create -f web-service.yaml\nVerify that the service has been created with the following command: kubectl get services\nLocate the external IP (let’s call it EXTERNAL-IP) of the web service and type the URL http://EXTERNAL-IP:8080 in your Web browser. You should see a Web page where the phrase Pet store appears. 4.3 The db service: StatefulSet Kubernetes has defined a special type of ReplicaSet for stateful services that is called StatefulSet.\nLet’s define a StatefulSet to give the specification of the db service.\napiVersion: apps/v1 kind: StatefulSet metadata: name: db spec: selector: matchLabels: app: pets service: db serviceName: db template: metadata: labels: app: pets service: db spec: containers: - image: quercinigia/pet-store-db:1.0 name: db ports: - containerPort: 5432 volumeMounts: - mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data name: pets-data volumeClaimTemplates: - metadata: name: pets-data spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 100Mi By now you shouldn’t have any problem understanding the meaning of the fields in this specification. The fields are also documented in the official Kubernetes documentation. Two points are worth a comment. First, the specification of a StatefulSet needs an attribute serviceName that indicates the name of the service that is responsible for the network identify of the pods in the set. That attribute is mandatory. This is listed as one of the limitations of a StatefulSet. Another novelty is the field volumeClaimTemplates. It describes additional constraints on the volumes defined in the specification, in this case the volume named pets-data (where PostgreSQL keeps the data). In particular, two claims are given:\nThe access mode ReadWriteOnce means that the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node in the Kubernetes cluster. Access modes are documented here.\nWe request at least 100MB of storage for the database.\nActivity\nCopy and paste the previous specification to a new file db-stateful-set.yaml (or any name of your liking). Make sure that you replace the image quercinigia/pet-store-db:1.0 with the one that you pushed to your DockerHub registry.\nUse the command cd in the terminal to position yourself in the directory where the file db-stateful-set.yaml is stored.\nDeploy this StatefulSet in Kubernetes by typing the following command:\nkubectl create -f db-stateful-set.yaml\nExercise\nExercise 4.5 Type the command:\nkubectl get all\nWhich objects have been created when you deployed the StatefulSet?\nExercise\nExercise 4.6 Open the Web browser and type the following URL:\nIf you’re using Docker Desktop\nhttp://localhost:8080/pet\nIf you’re using Minikube on the Linux VM\nhttp://minikube-ip:8080/pet\nwhere you’ll replace minikube-ip with the external IP address associated with the web service.\nRight after, type the command kubectl get all. What do you observe? Can you explain the reason?\nIn the output of the command get kubectl all, look at the names of the pods that are instances of the web service. Take the name of any these pods, and put it in place of NAME-OF-POD in the following command:\nkubectl logs NAME-OF-POD --previous\nExercise\nExercise 4.7 Does the output of the previous command confirm the explanation given in the previous question?\n5 The db service: Service object From the above observations, we understand that we need to define a service to expose the database to the clients.\nExercise\nExercise 5.1 Should the db service be accessible to client applications that are external to the Kubernetes cluster?\nExercise\nExercise 5.2 Given the answer to the previous question, what should the type of this service be?\nExercise\nExercise 5.3 Write the specification of the db service in a file named db-service.yaml (or any other name of your liking).\nCaution. In the file db-stateful-set.yaml the field spec.serviceName indicates the name that the service must have.\nActivity\nDeploy the service by typing the following command: kubectl create -f db-service.yaml\nVerify that the service has been created with the following command: kubectl get all\nVerify that you can reach the application at http://localhost:8080/pet (Minikube users: replace localhost with the external IP address associated to the web service!). It might happen that the database service is not ready yet, and so you’ll get a connection error. Just wait and retry later. 5.1 Shutting down the application After you’re done with the application, you can shut it down with the following commands:\nkubectl delete svc/web\nkubectl delete svc/db\nkubectl delete deploy/web\nkubectl delete statefulset/db\nThe order in which you type these commands doesn’t matter.\nIf you type multiple times the command:\nkubectl get all\nyou should see that the resources progressively disappear.\n5.2 Conclusion In the previous exercises, we deployed an application with two services, for which we had to create four files and type as many commands. For larger applications this gets a bit annoying. We can write all the definitions in a single file (e.g., pets.yaml) where each specification is terminated by - - -.\nHere is an example, where we write the specification of the Service and Deployment associated with the service web.\napiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: web spec: type: LoadBalancer ports: - port: 8080 targetPort: 3000 protocol: TCP selector: app: pets service: web --- apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: web spec: replicas: 3 selector: matchLabels: app: pets service: web template: metadata: labels: app: pets service: web spec: containers: - image: quercinigia/pet-store-web:1.0 name: web ports: - containerPort: 3000 protocol: TCP ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8f5b5b01a686c8fdb871e8a71fba8ba3","permalink":"/courses/cloud-computing/tutorials/tutorial-kube/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/cloud-computing/tutorials/tutorial-kube/","section":"courses","summary":"Text of the lab assignment on multi-service applications","tags":null,"title":"Multi-service applications","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Objectives In this lab assignment you will:\nGain a deeper understanding of the Docker networking model.\nBuild and deploy a multi-service application with Docker Compose.\nDeploy a multi-service application on a local Kubernetes cluster.\nDeploy a multi-service application on a Kubernetes cluster in Microsoft Azure.\nSubmission Only one submission per group.\nIn order to submit your work, you need to answer all the questions that you find here. Each question corresponds to an exercise that you find in this page.\nYou can answer either in French or in English. Your pick!\nDeadline: 13 May 2022, 23h59\nWarning\nThis lab assignment is evaluated. You won’t have access to the solutions. You can ask questions anytime (even after the Friday 29 april lab session), should you run into problems with the implementation of the assignment.\n1 Docker networking model We developed a simple chat room in Python that you can download here. The code has been adapted from this GitHub project.\nParticipants use a client program to connect to the chat room; the chat room is managed by a server application that receives the client connections and forwards the messages between the users. The archive contains the following files:\nclient.py. Implementation of the chat room client. server.py. Implementation of the chat room server. utils.py. Library with utility functions used in both client.py and server.py. The application is written in Python and it requires Python 3.7. The application doesn’t need any third-party library, the packages included in a minimal Python environment are enough.\nWarning\nOnly one instance of the server is running. Several instances of the client can run at the same time. Client instances might not be running on the same host.\nIn order to execute the server, we need to pass the port number as a parameter. In order to execute the client, we need to pass as parameters the IP address of the server and the port which the server listens to. Exercise\nExercise 1.1 Is a single Docker image for this application enough? Justify your answer.\nGiven your answer to the previous question, how many Docker images do you need to create? Exercise\nExercise 1.2 Build the image(s) for the application. For each image:\nUpload the Dockerfile to Edunao. Write the exact command that you used to build the image. Warning\nThe size of the images should be kept as small as possible. Remember to include in the images only what you need to build and run the application.\nGood to know\nIf you need to inspect the file system of an image that you create (e.g., to verify that the files that you copied are actually there), you can open a terminal in the image by using the following command:\ndocker run -it --entrypoint sh IMAGE_NAME\nExercise\nExercise 1.3 If you built more than one image:\nDo they have some common layers?\nIf so, is it something that has an impact on the build time and how? 1.1 Client and server on the same network We want to execute:\nOne instance of the server.\nTwo instances of the client.\nThe server, as well as the clients, will run in Docker containers attached to the same network.\nExercise\nExercise 1.4 We want to make sure that:\nThe server and the clients can communicate with each other.\nOther Docker containers cannot communicate neither with the server nor with the clients.\nHow can you satisfy both requirements in Docker? Explain your solution and justify it.\nExercise\nExercise 1.5 Execute the server and the two clients by using the network configuration that you explained in the previous exercise.\nThe server writes messages on the terminal. Remember to launch the container with the appropriate options in order to actually see those messages.\nUsers need to interact with the client, that is: read and write messages. Remember to launch the container with the appropriate options in order to actually see those messages.\nWrite the exact commands that you typed for both configuring the network and launching the server and the clients. Explain these commands.\nShut down the application!\nShut down both the clients and the server before you move on.\nOn the client-side, type #quit at any moment to exit the chat room.\nType Ctrl-C to stop the server.\n1.2 Client and server on different networks We want to execute:\nOne instance of the server.\nTwo instances of the client.\nHowever, neither client is connected to the same network as the server.\nExercise\nExercise 1.6 Why can’t you launch the containers with the same settings as in Exercise 1.5?\nWhat do you propose as a solution instead?\nHINT. You might want to look at slide 64 of the second lecture.\nExercise\nExercise 1.7 Execute the server and the two clients by making sure that neither client is connected to the same network as the server.\nWrite the exact commands that you typed for both configuring the network and launching the server and the clients. Explain these commands.\nShut down the application!\nShut down both the clients and the server before you move on.\nOn the client-side, type #quit at any moment to exit the chat room.\nType Ctrl-C to stop the server.\n2 Multi-service application: Docker Compose We intend to build and deploy the application TripMeal by using Docker Compose. You can download the application here. The source code has been readapted from this GitHub repository.\nThe downloaded file is an archive. Extracting the archive will create a folder named tripmeal_sujet.\nExercise\nExercise 2.1 Explain the structure of the content of the folder tripmeal_sujet.\nExercise\nExercise 2.2 How many services does the application have? Which technologies (i.e., programming languages, databases) are used in each service?\nThe Dockerfile in the directory db is already implemented.\nYour goal here is to write a Dockerfile in the directory web.\nIn case you get Exec format error\nIn order to avoid an Exec format error when you launch the application, you’ll need to add to your Dockerfile an instruction:\nRUN chmod -x path_to_file_app\nwhere path_to_file_app is the path to the file app.py inside the image.\nExercise\nExercise 2.3 Write the Dockerfile in the directory web. You need a Python 3.7 environment to run the application.\nUpload the Dockerfile to Edunao.\nIn the folder tripmeal_sujet, you’ll find a file named tripmeal.env. It contains the definition of environment variables that are used in the application.\nExercise\nExercise 2.4 Looking at the environment variables defined in file tripmeal.env:\nWhat does SERVER_PORT refer to? A port opened at one of the host network interfaces or a port opened at one of the container’s network interfaces?\nWhich environment variable tells you the name to assign to the database service?\nFeel free to answer this question after deploying the application.\nExercise\nExercise 2.5 What do you need to define in file docker-compose.yml to enable the communication between the different services?\nExercise\nExercise 2.6 Which base image is used to build a container for the database? Where is this base image stored? Can you find the documentation of this image in the Internet? Write down the link to the documentation page in the answer.\nExercise\nExercise 2.7 By looking at the documentation of the database image, what do you need to define in docker-compose.yml to make sure that the data is not deleted once the application is taken down?\nYou’re finally ready to complete the file docker-compose.yml.\nWarning\nRemember that you need to pass the environment variables to your application.\nAs a documentation of Docker Compose you can use:\nThe examples that we’ve seen together.\nThe overview presented on the official Docker website.\nYou can also find the full specification of Compose here.\nExercise\nExercise 2.8 Write the file docker-compose.yml. Build, deploy and test your application.\nUpload the file docker-compose.yml to Edunao.\nExercise\nExercise 2.9 Use Docker Compose to push all the images that you built in this section to your DockerHub registry.\nIn the answer to this exercise write:\nthe command that you execute to push the images. the link to the uploaded images. Shut down the application!\nShut down both the application before you move on.\n3 Local Kubernetes cluster We intend to deploy the application TripMeal on a local Kubernetes cluster (either Docker Desktop or Minikube).\nExercise\nExercise 3.1 Specify which services are stateless and which ones are stateful. Justify your answer.\nExercise\nExercise 3.2 For each service of the application TripMeal, specify the Kubernetes objects that you need to create and their types. Justify your answers.\nHelp\nIn order to write the specification of each object, you can refer to the examples that we discussed together in the second tutorial. You can also refer to the API documentation on the Kubernetes website.\nExercise\nExercise 3.3 For each Kubernetes object:\nConfigure. Write a Yaml configuration file. Remember that you need to pass the application the environment variables.\nCreate. Create the object in Kubernetes with kubectl.\nAnalyze. Execute the command kubectl get all and explain in detail which objects appear in the output as the result of step 2.\nActivity\nPlay with the application in order to verify that everything works as expected.\nShut down the application!\nShut down the application by removing all the Kubernetes objects.\nExercise\nExercise 3.4 Create a new file called tripmeal.yml that contains the definition of all the Kubernetes objects of the application, as we have seen in the conclusion of the tutorial 2.\nUpload this file to Edunao.\n4 Kubernetes cluster on Microsoft Azure You’re now going to create a Kubernetes cluster on Microsoft Azure and deploy TripMeal on that cluster.\nWarning\nIn order to perform this activity, you need a student subscription on Microsoft Azure. If you haven’t activated it yet:\nConnect to this webpage.\nClick on Start free.\nSign in by using your CentraleSupélec credentials.\nFollow the instructions.\nDuring this activity, you’ll need to answer some questions that encourage you to gain a deeper knowledge of the Azure platform and better understand the commands that you type. Feel free to read the documentation on the Azure platform in order to answer the questions.\n4.1 Login to Azure through CLI Warning\nIf you get “command not found” when you type az, it means that you haven’t installed the Azure CLI yet. You’ll find more information on the Edunao course page.\nMake sure you run version 2.25 or higher of the Azure CLI, by typing:\naz --version If you use a VM with Multipass you’ll need to install the Azure CLI with the following command:\ncurl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash If you use a VM either with Multipass or with VirtualBox you’ll need to re-install kubectl:\nType the following command so as the command kubectl does not refer to minikube kubectl anymore: unalias kubectl Type the following command to install a new version of kubectl: sudo az aks install-cli Whether you’re on Windows, macOS or Linux, you need to open a terminal.\nIn order to log in to your Azure account, type the following command:\naz login A Web page will open in your default Web browser, where you can type your username and password (your CentraleSupélec credentials). After authenticating your Azure account, you can go back to the terminal, where you should see some information about your account, such as:\n[ { \u0026quot;cloudName\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;AzureCloud\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;homeTenantId\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;id\u0026gt;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;id\u0026gt;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;isDefault\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;managedByTenants\u0026quot;: [], \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Azure for Students\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;state\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Enabled\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tenantId\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;id\u0026gt;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;user\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;email-address\u0026gt;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;user\u0026quot; } } ] 4.2 Deploy and use Azure Container Registry When we run TripMeal on a local Kubernetes cluster, we assumed that our computer could have a direct access to the Internet and, therefore, to the DockerHub registry, where we could pull the images of the TripMeal services. When we run a containerized application in production, we cannot make this assumption as the production servers have often no direct access to the Internet.\nExercise\nExercise 4.1 In your view, why isn’t it a good idea to have production servers directly connected to the Internet?\nWe need to place the images in a container registry that is in the same context as our production servers. Since we’re going to run the application on Azure, we can use the Azure Container Registry (ACR).\n4.2.1 Registry creation First, we need to create a resource group.\nExercise\nExercise 4.2 What is a resource group in Azure and how is it useful?\nThe command to create a new resource group is the following (replace RES_GRP_NAME with a name of your choice).\naz group create --name RES_GRP_NAME --location eastus Next, we need to create a container registry with the following command (replace RES_GRP_NAME with the name of your resource group and REG_NAME with a name of your choice for the registry).\naz acr create --resource-group RES_GRP_NAME --name REG_NAME --sku Basic Exercise\nExercise 4.3 In the previous command, what does sku refer to? Feel free to look up on the Azure website to find the answer.\n4.2.2 Registry login After creating the registry, we can log into it with the following command:\naz acr login --name REG_NAME 4.2.3 Image tagging We’re almost ready to push the images that compose the application TripMeal to the registry. In order to do that, we need to tag (i.e., rename) our images so that their names are preceded by the login server name of the registry.\nIn order to get the name of the login server name (that we denote here as acrloginserver) of your registry, you can type the following command:\naz acr list --resource-group RES_GRP_NAME --query \u0026quot;[].{acrLoginServer:loginServer}\u0026quot; --output table Your acrloginserver will be something like xxx.azurecr.io.\nExercise\nExercise 4.4 Tag the images that correspond to the services of the application TripMeal so that their name is similar to: acrloginserver/nameofimage:latest\nWrite the exact Docker command that you use to tag the images.\n4.2.4 Pushing the images We can push the images with the following command (use your image name instead of xxx.azurecr.io/imagename:latest).\ndocker push xxx.azurecr.io/imagename:latest Make sure to type this command for each image that you want to push.\nWarning\nIt might take few minutes before the images are completely pushed to the registry.\nFinally, verify that the images are actually in the registry with the following command:\naz acr repository list --name REG_NAME --output table Alternatively, you can connect to your Azure portal and visually browse your resources.\n4.3 Deploy a Kubernetes cluster We now deploy a Kubernetes cluster on Azure.\n4.3.1 Cluster creation We create the cluster with the following command (replace CLUSTER_NAME with a name of your choice. As before, RES_GRP_NAME is the name of your resource group and REG_NAME is the name of the container registry).\naz aks create \\ --resource-group RES_GRP_NAME \\ --name CLUSTER_NAME \\ --node-count 2 \\ --generate-ssh-keys \\ --attach-acr REG_NAME The cluster will take a while to start. Time for a coffee! But before, answer the following question!\nExercise\nExercise 4.5 Can you tell the meaning of the options in the previous command?\n4.3.2 Connect to the cluster We can configure kubectl to connect to the newly created cluster. You need to type the following command:\naz aks get-credentials --resource-group RES_GRP_NAME --name CLUSTER_NAME Now, your Kubernetes cluster should be visible locally. To verify it, type the following command:\nkubectl config get-contexts Here context refers to the Kubernetes clusters that kubectl has access to. The Kubernetes cluster that you created on Azure should be visible in the output; an asterisk should appear in front of its name, indicating that it is the current context (that is the Kubernetes cluster being currently referenced by kubectl).\nType the following command:\nkubectl get nodes You should see that the Kubernetes cluster has two nodes.\n4.4 Deploy the application We’re almost done! The images are in the registry, the Kubernetes cluster is up and running. The only missing piece of the puzzle is our application TripMeal.\nFirst thing to do is to slightly modify the file tripmeal.yml that you created at the end of the previous section.\nExercise\nExercise 4.6 Look at the names of the images of each service in that file. How must these names change? Modify the file accordingly (no need to upload it on Edunao).\nIt is the moment of truth! Deploy your application by typing the following command:\nkubectl apply -f tripmeal.yml Look at Kubernetes objects created after this command:\nkubectl get all Get the external IP address of the web service and try to connect to the application, in the same way you did in the previous section.\nIf you can play with the application like you did in your local deployment it means that you reached the conclusion of this assignment! Bravo!\nExercise\nExercise 4.7 Submit a video like that the one that you can see here.\nThe video must clearly show that:\nYou’re connected to your Azure portal (Email address on the top right corner of the portal).\nAll the passages that you see in the sample video: you need to show the public IP address of the application that you deployed, use that address to connect to your application and play with the application to show that it works correctly.\nThe next exercise is optional. Before you leave, make sure to read the conclusion of this document!!.\nExercise\nExercise 4.8 The title of this exercise is Cerise sur le gâteau (aka, this is optional!).\nAt this point, you can connect to TripMeal by using an IP address. It would be nice if you could use a URL, like in the real websites. Can you find a way to assign a URL to your web service? Describe your procedure.\nYou need a bit of Googling here….\nConclusion Make sure you follow these instructions:\nTake down your application in Kubernetes by using the following command: kubectl delete -f tripmeal.yml Change the context of the kubectl command so that it points back to a local Kubernetes cluster. Type the following command, where CONTEXT_NAME will be docker-desktop or minikube, depending on which local Kubernetes cluster you use. kubectl config use-context CONTEXT_NAME Destroy all the resources linked to the application TripMeal on Microsoft Azure, otherwise you’ll get billed even if you don’t use them! You can destroy all the resources by simply deleting the resource group to which they belong. You can do it through the Azure portal or by typing the following command (replace RES_GRP_NAME with the name of the resource group that you intend to remove). az group delete --name RES_GRP_NAME You can check the balance of your Azure credit here.\nYou can stop Docker and Kubernetes if you don’t need it anymore.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"427e5cadc0e40c7a1fa326dad07bcb5a","permalink":"/courses/cloud-computing/labs/kube-lab/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/cloud-computing/labs/kube-lab/","section":"courses","summary":"Text of the lab assignment on Docker + Kubernetes","tags":null,"title":"Multi-service applications in the Cloud","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" 1 Computing averages We are given a dataset that contains the average monthly temperature measurements over the course of some years. More precisely, the dataset is stored in a CSV file, where each row corresponds to a monthly measurement and the columns contain the following values: year, month, average temperature in the month.\n1980,1,5 1980,2,2 1980,3,10 1980,4,14 1980,5,17 .... 1981,1,2 1981,2,1 1981,3,3 1981,4,10 .... We intend to get the average monthly temperature for each year.\nExercise\nExercise 1.1 Write a MapReduce algorithm that generates key-value pairs \\((year, average\\_temperature)\\).\nSolution\nmap: \\((year, month, temperature) \\rightarrow (year, temperature)\\)\nreduce: \\((year, temps) \\rightarrow\\) \\((year, sum(temps)/len(temps))\\)\n\\(temps\\) is the list of all temperatures in the same \\(year\\). \\(sum(temps)\\) sums all the elements in the list \\(temps\\). \\(len(temps)\\) gives the length of the list \\(temps\\). Suppose now that we have a large CSV file stored in a distributed file system (e.g., HDFS), containing a series of measurements in the format “Year, Month, Day, Minute, Second, Temperature”. We can have up to one measurement per second in some years. Like before, we’d like to compute key-value pairs (year, average_temperature) by using a MapReduce algorithm.\nExercise\nExercise 1.2 What is the maximum number of measurements in a year?\nSolution\nSince we can have up to one measurement per second, the maximum number of measurements \\(M_{max}\\) for a certain year is given by the following formula:\n\\[ M_{max} = 365 \\times 24 \\times 60 \\times 60 \\approx 31.5 \\times 10^6 \\]\nExercise\nExercise 1.3 Considering the answer to the previous question, discuss the efficiency of the first implementation of the algorithm.\nSolution\nSince there might be up to 31 million values associated with a key, the bottleneck of the computation would be the shuffle operation, since we need to copy a high number of (key,value) pairs from the mappers to the reducers.\nAlso, a reducer might have to loop over a huge list of values in order to compute their average.\nExercise\nExercise 1.4 Based on the answer to the previous question, propose a better implementation to handle the CSV file.\nSolution\nmap: \\((year, mo, d, mi, sec, temperature) \\rightarrow (year, temperature)\\)\ncombine: \\((year, temps) \\rightarrow\\) \\((year, (sum(temps), len(temps)))\\)\nreduce: \\((year, [(s_i, l_i),\\ i=1\\dots n]) \\rightarrow\\) \\((year, \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n s_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^n l_i})\\)\n\\(temps\\) is the list of all temperatures in the same \\(year\\). \\(sum(temps)\\) sums all the elements in the list \\(temps\\). \\(len(temps)\\) gives the length of the list \\(temps\\). 2 Common friends in a social network Consider a social network described by a graph encoded in a text file. Each line of the file is a list of identifiers separated by commas. For instance, the line \\(A,B,C,D\\) means that \\(A\\) is friend with \\(B\\), \\(C\\) and \\(D\\). An excerpt of the file looks like as follows:\nA,B,C,D B,A,D C,A,D D,A,B,C ... We suppose that the friendship relation is symmetric: \\((A, B)\\) implies \\((B, A)\\).\nWe want to obtain the list of the common friends for each pair of individuals:\n(A, B), [D] (A, C), [D] (A, D), [B, C] (B, C), [D] (B, D), [A] (C, D), [A] As an additional constraint, we want to represent a couple only once and avoid to represent the symmetric couple. In other words, if we output \\((A, B)\\), we don’t want to output \\((B, A)\\).\nExercise\nExercise 2.1 Propose a MapReduce implementation to find the common friends in a social network satisifying the given constraints.\nSolution\nmap: \\((x, F) \\rightarrow [((u, v), x)\\ \\forall (u, v) \\in F\\ |\\ u \u0026lt; v ]\\)\nreduce: \\([(u, v), LCF] \\rightarrow [(u, v), LCF]\\)\nwhere:\n\\(x\\) is the first item in a line. \\(F\\) is the list containing the items in a line except the first one (\\(x\\)’s friends). \\(LCF\\) is the list of all individuals that are friends with both \\(u\\) and \\(v\\). We note that the reduce function is the identity.\n\u0026lt;!– # Creating an inverted index\nWe have a collection of \\(n\\) documents in a directory and we want to create an inverted index, one that associates each word to the list of the files the word occurs in. More precisely, for each word, the inverted index will have a list of the names of the documents that contain the word.\nExercise\nExercise 2.2 Propose a MapReduce implementation to create an inverted index over a collection of documents.\nSolution\nThe input to the map will be a key-value pair, where the key is the name of a file \\(f\\) and the value is the content \\(C\\) of the file.\nmap: \\((f, C) \\rightarrow [(w, f)\\ \\forall w \\in C]\\)\nreduce: \\((w, L) \\rightarrow (w, L)\\)\nwhere \\(L\\) is the list of the files containing the word \\(w\\).\nWe note that the reduce function is the identity.\nNote also that in the map function we can add instructions to preprocess the text. For example, we can eliminate some words that are not useful in the index (e.g., the stopwords) or remove special symbols.\n3 Computing average and standard deviation We consider again the large CSV file with a series of measurements in the format “Year, Month, Day, Minute, Second, Temperature”. We now intend to generate a series of key-value pairs (year, (avg_temperature, std_deviation)).\nWe can express the standard deviation of \\(n\\) values \\(x_i\\) (\\(1 \\leq i \\leq n\\)) with two different equations.\nThe first equation is as follows:\n\\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}{n}} \\]\nThe second equation is as follows:\n\\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\overline{x^2} - \\overline{x}^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i)^2}{n} - \\Bigg(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}\\Bigg)^2} \\]\nExercise\nExercise 3.1 Which equation of the standard deviation is more appropriate in a Map-Reduce algorithm? Why?\nSolution\nThe second equation is more appropriate because it allows the computation of the sum of the elements and of the square of the elements step by step by using map and combine together.\nInstead, if we use the first equation, we need first to compute the average and then use it to compute the variance.\nExercise\nExercise 3.2 Propose a MapReduce implementation to compute the average and the standard deviation of the temperatures for each year. Solution\nmap: \\((year, mo, d, mi, sec, temperature) \\rightarrow (year, temperature)\\)\ncombine: \\((year, T) \\rightarrow\\) \\((year, (sum(T), sum(T^2), len(T)))\\)\nreduce: \\((year, [(s_{i}, sq_{i}, l_{i}),\\ i=1\\dots n]) \\rightarrow\\) \\((year, (\\mu, \\sigma))\\)\nwhere:\n\\(T\\) is the list of all temperatures in the same \\(year\\). \\(sum(T)\\) sums all the elements in the list \\(T\\). \\(T^2 = [x^2 | x\\in T]\\) \\(len(T)\\) gives the length of the list \\(T\\). \\(\\mu = \\sum_{i=1}^n s_{i}/ \\sum_{i=1}^n l_{i}\\) \\(\\sigma = \\sqrt{ (\\sum_{i=1}^n sq_{i}/ \\sum_{i=1}^n l_{i}) - \\mu^2 }\\) ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0cbba47479da04631bd931db00bad3ff","permalink":"/courses/bdia/tutorials/map-reduce/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/bdia/tutorials/map-reduce/","section":"courses","summary":"Description of the MapReduce tutorial.","tags":null,"title":"MapReduce","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" 1 Computing averages We are given a dataset that contains the average monthly temperature measurements over the course of some years.

Like before, we’d like to compute key-value pairs (year, average_temperature) by using a MapReduce algorithm.\nExercise\nExercise 1.2 What is the maximum number of measurements in a year?\nSolution\nSince we can have up to one measurement per second, the maximum number of measurements \\(M_{max}\\) for a certain year is given by the following formula:\n\\[ M_{max} = 365 \\times 24 \\times 60 \\times 60 \\approx 31.5 \\times 10^6 \\]\nExercise\nExercise 1.3 Considering the answer to the previous question, discuss the efficiency of the first implementation of the algorithm.\nSolution\nSince there might be up to 31 million values associated with a key, the bottleneck of the computation would be the shuffle operation, since we need to copy a high number of (key,value) pairs from the mappers to the reducers.\nAlso, a reducer might have to loop over a huge list of values in order to compute their average.\nExercise\nExercise 1.4 Based on the answer to the previous question, propose a better implementation to handle the CSV file.\nSolution\nmap: \\((year, mo, d, mi, sec, temperature) \\rightarrow (year, temperature)\\)\ncombine: \\((year, temps) \\rightarrow\\) \\((year, (sum(temps), len(temps)))\\)\nreduce: \\((year, [(s_i, l_i),\\ i=1\\dots n]) \\rightarrow\\) \\((year, \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n s_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^n l_i})\\)\n\\(temps\\) is the list of all temperatures in the same \\(year\\). \\(sum(temps)\\) sums all the elements in the list \\(temps\\). \\(len(temps)\\) gives the length of the list \\(temps\\). 2 Common friends in a social network Consider a social network described by a graph encoded in a text file. Each line of the file is a list of identifiers separated by commas. For instance, the line \\(A,B,C,D\\) means that \\(A\\) is friend with \\(B\\), \\(C\\) and \\(D\\). An excerpt of the file looks like as follows:\nA,B,C,D B,A,D C,A,D D,A,B,C ... We suppose that the friendship relation is symmetric: \\((A, B)\\) implies \\((B, A)\\).\nWe want to obtain the list of the common friends for each pair of individuals:\n(A, B), [D] (A, C), [D] (A, D), [B, C] (B, C), [D] (B, D), [A] (C, D), [A] As an additional constraint, we want to represent a couple only once and avoid to represent the symmetric couple. In other words, if we output \\((A, B)\\), we don’t want to output \\((B, A)\\).\nExercise\nExercise 2.1 Propose a MapReduce implementation to find the common friends in a social network satisifying the given constraints.\nSolution\nmap: \\((x, F) \\rightarrow [((u, v), x)\\ \\forall (u, v) \\in F\\ |\\ u \u0026lt; v ]\\)\nreduce: \\([(u, v), LCF] \\rightarrow [(u, v), LCF]\\)\nwhere:\n\\(x\\) is the first item in a line. \\(F\\) is the list containing the items in a line except the first one (\\(x\\)’s friends). \\(LCF\\) is the list of all individuals that are friends with both \\(u\\) and \\(v\\). We note that the reduce function is the identity.\n3 Computing average and standard deviation We consider again the large CSV file with a series of measurements in the format “Year, Month, Day, Minute, Second, Temperature”. We now intend to generate a series of key-value pairs (year, (avg_temperature, std_deviation)).\nWe can express the standard deviation of \\(n\\) values \\(x_i\\) (\\(1 \\leq i \\leq n\\)) with two different equations.\nThe first equation is as follows:\n\\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}{n}} \\]\nThe second equation is as follows:\n\\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\overline{x^2} - \\overline{x}^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i)^2}{n} - \\Bigg(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}\\Bigg)^2} \\]\nExercise\nExercise 3.1 Which equation of the standard deviation is more appropriate in a Map-Reduce algorithm? Why?\nSolution\nThe second equation is more appropriate because it allows the computation of the sum of the elements and of the square of the elements step by step by using map and combine together.\nInstead, if we use the first equation, we need first to compute the average and then use it to compute the variance.\nExercise\nExercise 3.2 Propose a MapReduce implementation to compute the average and the standard deviation of the temperatures for each year.

Looking at the documentation, try to identify the object that you need to use to create a linear regressor and the function that you need to invoke to train the linear regressor.\nUncomment Lines 121, 124, 125, 126 to call the function train_linear_regression_model and display the coefficients learned by the linear regression model.\nExecute the file train_test_model with spark-submit. Solution\nThe solutions are available in file:\n/usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib_solutions/train_test_model.py We can now use the trained model to make some predictions. The model returned by the function that you implemented in the previous exercise is an object of type LinearRegressionModel. Looking at the documentation, we learn that there is a function predict that allows us to make a prediction given a single instance. If we want to make a prediction on the whole test set, we should use the function transform. The function takes in a DataFrame with the test set and returns the same DataFrame with an additional column prediction that contains the predicted value.\nExercise\nExercise 2.4 Look at Lines 130 and 131. Which DataFrame do we need to pass the function transform? Is test_df a good choice? Why?\nComplete line 130 and uncomment lines 130, 131, 132.\nExecute the file train_test_model with spark-submit and observe the result. Is the predicted value the one that you expect given that you know the formula of the regression line? Solution\ntest_df is not a good choice. In fact, the test set DataFrame must have the same format as the training set DataFrame the model has been trained on. So, we need to transform it a vecAssembler.\nThe solutions are available in file:\n/usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib_solutions/train_test_model.py 3 Pipelines In the previous section we learned that a training and test set need to go through the same transformation steps in order to be fed to a machine learning model. When we have few transformations, it is easy to remember the ones that we applied to a training set, so as to apply them to the test set too. However, when we need to apply a series of transformations, the order of which is important, it is easy to make mistakes (applying different sets of transformations to the training and test instances, which leads to meaningless predictions).\nA good practice is to use the Pipeline API. A pipeline is composed of stages. Each stage may be a transformer or an estimator. A transformer is an object on which we call the function transform to obtain a new DataFrame from an input DataFrame. An estimator is an object on which we call the function fit to learn a model on a given DataFrame. The learned model is itself a transformer.\nWhen the function fit is called on a Pipeline, the training set goes through all the transformers and the estimators in the order in which they are declared in the pipeline; at last, the estimator specified in the last stage is trained on the training set. The model returned by applying the function fit on the pipeline is itself a transformer. If we invoke the function transform on that model on the test set, we obtain a DataFrame that contains a column named predictions. Implicitly, all the transformations in the pipeline will be applied to the test set too, before making the predictions.\nCopy the file pipeline_example.py to your home folder in the cluster by typing the following command:\ncp /usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib/pipeline_example.py . Exercise\nExercise 3.1 Look at the documentation and write a code from Line 34 to create a pipeline that does the same operations as in file train_test_model.py to train and test a linear regression model on the given training and test sets.\nDon’t forget to specify the paths to the training and test set files on HDFS at Lines 27 and 28. Solution\nSolutions available in file:\n/usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib_solutions/pipeline_example.py 3.1 From categorical to numerical features Many machine learning models do not handle categorical values: they need all features to be numerical. Linear regression is such an example.\nActivity\nCopy the file onehot_playground.py to your home directory in the cluster by typing the following command: cp /usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib/onehot_playground.py . Change lines 27 and 28 and write the paths to the files with the training and test sets. First, let’s find out which features are categorical in our dataset.\nExercise\nExercise 3.2 Complete the function get_categorical_columns.\nIn order to get an idea as to how to get the categorical columns, execute the code with spark_submit. This execute the instruction at Line 86.\nOnce you’re done with the implementation, execute the file with spark-submit and observe the output.\nSolution\nSolutions available in file:\n/usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib_solutions/onehot_playground.py One example of categorical feature in our dataset is property_type, which takes values such as Apartment, House, Condominium… Each value of a categorical feature is also referred to as a category.\nOne way to turn this feature into a numerical one would be to assign a number to each category (e.g., Apartment corresponds to 0, House to 1….). However, this implicitly introduces an order among the categories: the category House would be worth twice as much as the category Apartment; this would inevitably bias the trained model.\nA commonly used method is one-hot encoding. Let’s find out how it works. Let’s focus only on the feature property_type.\nActivity\nUncomment Lines 40, 41 and 42. These lines instantiate an estimator that is called StringIndexer. This estimator associates numeric indexes to the values of property_type. The indexes will be stored in another column named property_type_index.\nUncomment Line 46. The StringIndexer is applied to the training set to learn how to associate indexes to the values of property_type. The result of the instruction is a new transformer.\nUncomment Line 49. The transformer learned on Line 46 is used to transform the training set into a new DataFrame. This DataFrame contains an additional column called property_type_index.\nExercise\nExercise 3.3 Complete the function count_property_types. Follow the instructions in the file.\nOnce the function is complete, uncomment Line 53 to call the function.\nExecute the file with spark-submit and observe the output. Can you guess how the indexes are assigned to the categories of the feature property_type?\nSolution\nSolutions available in file:\n/usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib_solutions/onehot_playground.py We note that the most frequent property type obtains the index 0; the second most frequent will obtain value 1…so the indexes are attributed by frequency. Each time we run the same code, we obtain the same indexes. This means that we have a determinism over different executions of the same program.\nIt is time to find out how one-hot encoding works.\nActivity\nUncomment Lines 57, 58, 61, 64, 67. These lines instantiate an estimator that is called OneHotEncoder. This estimator uses the indexes in property_type_index and creates a new column property_type_ohe.\nThe estimator is trained on the training set and a new transformer is obtained (line 61).\nThe transformer is used on the training set to transform it into a new DataFrame, where a new column property_type_ohe exists.\nLine 67 prints selected columns of this transformed training set.\nExercise\nExercise 3.4 Execute the file with spark-submit.\nCan you understand how one-hot encoding works? Solution\nSolutions available in file:\n/usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib_solutions/onehot_playground.py One-hot creates a vector with as many values as the number of categories in the feature property_type. Each category has a fixed index in this vector, given by the column property_type_index. If for an instance the value of the property_type is Guest suite and the index of Guest suite is 3, then the one-hot encoded vector has only a value 1 at index 3 and 0 anywhere else. Spark only stores a concise representation of this sparse vector: a tuple with the size of the vector, the index whose value is non-zero and the actual value associated to the index (1 in our case).\nNow, you have all the ingredients to create a full pipeline to train and test a linear regression model by using all features.\nExercise\nExercise 3.5 Create a new file full_pipeline.py where:\nYou select the categorical features.\nSet up a StringIndexer and a OneHotEncoder to apply one-hot encoding to all categorical features.\nObtain the numeric features.\nSet up a VectorAssembler to put into a single vector the one-hot encoded features and the numerical ones.\nSet up a linear regression model that takes in all features and the variable to predict (price).\nMix all these ingredients in a Pipeline.\nUse the Pipeline to train and test the model. Solution\nSolutions available in file:\n/usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib_solutions/full_pipeline.py 4 Evaluating a model In the previous sections we visually looked at the predictions to get an vague idea of how our estimator performs. In order to quantify the quality of our estimator, we need some evaluation measures.\nExercise\nExercise 4.1 Look at the documentation and play with the code to do model selection based on a grid search of parameters.\nSolution\nThe solutions are available in file\n/usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_quercini/mllib_solutions/model_evaluation.py ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"99e158e4ab050341594fbee7e30fcc18","permalink":"/courses/bdia/tutorials/mllib/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/bdia/tutorials/mllib/","section":"courses","summary":"Description of the Spark MLlib tutorial","tags":null,"title":"Spark MLlib","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" 1 Use case scenario We consider a relational database that holds the data of a chain of DVD stores; the database name is Sakila.\nThe Sakila database is serving an increasing number of queries from staff and customers around the world. A single monolithic database is not sufficient anymore to serve all the requests and the company is thinking of distributing the database across several servers (horizontal scalability). However, a relational database does not handle horizontal scalability very well, due to the fact that the data is scattered across numerous tables, as the result of the normalization process. Hence, the Sakila team is turning to you to help them migrate the database from PostgreSQL to MongoDB.\nFor the migration to happen, it is necessary to conceive a suitable data model. From the first discussions with the Sakila management, you quickly understand that one of the main use of the database is to manage (add, update and read) rental information.\n1.1 Description of the relational model The existing data model is recalled in Figure 1.1.\nFigure 1.1: The logical schema of the Sakila database Here is the description of the tables:\nThe table actor lists information for all actors. Columns: actor_id, first_name, last_name.\nThe table address contains address information for customers, staff and stores. Columns: address_id, address, address2, district, city_id, postal_code, phone.\nThe table category lists the categories that can be assigned to a film. Columns: category_id, name.\nThe table city contains a list of cities. Columns: city_id, city, country_id.\nThe table country contains a list of countries. Columns: country_id, country.\nThe table customer contains a list of all customers. Columns: customer_id, store_id, first_name, last_name, email, address_id, active, create_date.\nThe table film is a list of all films potentially in stock in the stores. The actual in-stock copies of each film are represented in the inventory table. Columns: film_id, title, description, release_year, language_id, original_language_id, rental_duration, rental_rate, length.\nThe table film_actor is used to support a many-to-many relationship between films and actors. Columns: film_id, actor_id.\nThe table film_category is used to support a many-to-many relationship between films and categories. Columns: film_id, category_id.\nThe table inventory contains one row for each copy of a given film in a given store. Columns: inventory_id, film_id, store_id.\nThe table language contains possible languages that films can have for their language and original language values. Columns: language_id, name.\nThe table payment records each payment made by a customer, with information such as the amount and the rental being paid for. Columns: payment_id, customer_id, staff_id, rental_id, amount, payment_date.\nThe table rental contains one row for each rental of each inventory item with information about who rented what item, when it was rented, and when it was returned. Columns: rental_id, rental_date, inventory_id, customer_id, return_date, staff_id.\nThe table staff lists all staff members. Columns: staff_id, first_name, last_name, address_id, picture, email, store_id, active, username, password.\nThe table store lists all stores in the system. Columns: store_id, manager_staff_id, address_id.\n2 Data types in MongDB A MongoDB document is represented as a JSON record. However, internally MongoDB serializes the JSON record into a BSON record. In practice, a BSON record is a binary representation of a JSON record.\nExercise\nExercise 2.1 Looking at the specification of BSON, can you tell how many bytes do you need to represent: an integer, a date, a string and a boolean?\nExercise\nExercise 2.2 The size of a document in MongoDB is limited to 16 MiB. Can you tell why there is such a limit?\nThe table rental has four integer columns (rental_id, inventory_id, customer_id, staff_id) and 2 dates (rental_date, return_date).\nThe table customer has three integer columns (customer_id, store_id, address_id), three strings (first_name, last_name and email), one boolean value (active) and one date (create_date).\nExercise\nExercise 2.3 Suppose that we want to create a MongoDB collection to list all rentals, and a separate collection to list all customers.\nEstimate the size of a document in both collections.\nWe make the following assumptions:\nOn average, each character needs 1.5 bytes.\nAn email address is 20 characters long on average.\nA last name is 8 characters long on average.\nA first name is 6 characters long on average. 3 Considerations for the new model Denormalization in MongoDB is strongly encouraged to read and write a record relative to an entity in one single operation.\nIn the following exercises, we explore different options and analyze advantages and disadvantages.\nExercise\nExercise 3.1 Suppose that we create a collection Customer, where each document includes information about a customer.\nSuppose that we embed in each document the list of rentals for a customer.\nHow many rentals can we store for a given customer, knowing that the size of a document in MongoDB cannot exceed 16 MiB?\nExercise\nExercise 3.2 Consider the two following options:\nA collection customer, where each document contains the information about a customer and an embedded list with the information on all the rentals made by the customer.\nA collection rental, where each document contains the information about a rental and an embedded document with the information on the customer that made the rental.\nCompute the size in byte of a document in the two collections.\nExercise\nExercise 3.3 Suppose that we have in our database\n512 customers.\n16384 rentals.\nOn average, each customer has around 32 rentals.\nCompute the size in byte of the collections customer and rental described in the previous question.\nExercise\nExercise 3.4 Based on the answers in the previous questions, discuss advantages and disadvantages of the two options: having a collection customer (solution 1) or a collection rental (solution 2).\nExercise\nExercise 3.5 Look again at the model in Figure 1.1. A rental document doesn’t only need to include information on the customer who made the rental, but also:\nThe staff member who took care of the rental.\nThe inventory item being rented.\nThe payment information.\nQuestions.\nDiscuss the different ways we can include this information in the collections customer and rental.\nBased on the discussion, which solution would you retain? A collection customer or a collection rental?\n4 The data model in MongoDB In the last question, we chose the collection that we intend to create.\nExercise\nExercise 4.1 Give the complete schema (name and type of the properties) of a document in the collection that you chose in the previous question.\nIf the value of any property is an embedded document:\nSpecify the schema of that document too.\nIf any property of an embedded document is an identifier referencing another entity, use that identifier (don’t try, for now, to further denormalize the schema).\nLet’s take a closer look at the storage requirements of the adopted solution. Consider that:\nThe size in bytes of a document storing the information of a staff member is around 64 KiB (65,536 bytes), because we store a profile picture.\nThe size in bytes of a document storing the information of an inventory item is 12 bytes.\nThe size in bytes of a document storing the information about a payment is 20 bytes.\nExercise\nExercise 4.2 If we denote by \\(N_{rental}\\) the number of rentals, what is the size in bytes of the database for the adopted solution? What do you get if we set \\(N_{rental}\\) to \\(10^4\\), \\(10^5\\) or \\(10^6\\) ?\nAlthough the size that we determined in the previous exercise, may not sound impressive, we still have to store other information (films, actors….). If we could save a bit of space, we would be happy.\nExercise\nExercise 4.3 Discuss how you could save some space in the adopted solution.\nHINT. Do you really need to denormalize all data?\nExercise\nExercise 4.4 Propose a solution for all the entities involved and estimate the savings in terms of storage requirements.\n5 The new model In this section we intend to obtain a complete model of the Sakila database.\nExercise\nExercise 5.1 Consider the model that we obtained at the end of the previous section. Which data can you further denormalize?\nExercise\nExercise 5.2 Complete the diagram obtained in the previous exercise so as to obtain a full data model for the Sakila database.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"bbbd127d5a872ded989651aa9b98e2f9","permalink":"/courses/bdia/tutorials/mongodb-modeling/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/bdia/tutorials/mongodb-modeling/","section":"courses","summary":"Data modeling in MongoDB","tags":null,"title":"MongoDB - Data modeling","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" We learn how to write queries in MongoDB on the Sakila database.\n1 Initialization Launch a MongoDB server on your computer.\nOpen MongoDB Compass.\nConnect to the MongoDB server with the following URI: mongodb://localhost:27017.\nDownload the this archive file and extract it.

How to determine the candidate keys of a table given its functional dependencies. How to determine the normal form of a table. 1 Question 1 We consider a relational table \\(R\\) with four columns \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\) and \\(D\\). Let \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) be the following set of functional dependencies:\n\\(AB \\rightarrow C\\)\n\\(D \\rightarrow BC\\)\n\\(A \\rightarrow B\\)\nExercise\nExercise 1.1 Derive a minimal set \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) of functional dependencies that is equivalent to \\(\\mathcal{F}\\).\nSolution\nWe first need to write the functional dependencies in canonical form (the right-side of each FD must consist of only one column).\nThe FD (2.) can be rewritten using the decomposition axiom.\n\\(AB \\rightarrow C\\)\n\\(D \\rightarrow B\\)\n\\(D \\rightarrow C\\)\n\\(A \\rightarrow B\\)\nNext, we need to make sure that all functional dependencies are left-irreducible.\nAll functional dependencies except the first one are trivially left-irreducible (the determinant consists of only one column). The first has two columns in the determinant, therefore we need to check whether we can eliminate one of the two columns and still preserve an equivalent set of functional dependencies.\nWe apply Armstrong’s axioms to compute the closure of this set of functional dependencies.\nFrom (1.) and (4.), we can apply the pseudotransitivity axiom and we obtain:\n\\[A \\rightarrow B \\wedge AB \\rightarrow C \\implies AA \\rightarrow C \\implies A \\rightarrow C\\]\nSince \\(A \\rightarrow C\\) is in the closure, the column \\(B\\) in FD (1.) is useless and can therefore be omitted.\nThe set \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) consists of the following FDs:\n\\(A \\rightarrow C\\)\n\\(D \\rightarrow B\\)\n\\(D \\rightarrow C\\)\n\\(A \\rightarrow B\\)\nNone of these functional dependencies are redundant.\n2 Question 2 Let \\(R\\) be a relational table with five columns \\((A, B, C, D, E)\\). The following set \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) of functional dependencies hold:\n\\(AB \\rightarrow C\\) \\(C \\rightarrow A\\) \\(C \\rightarrow B\\) \\(C \\rightarrow D\\) \\(D \\rightarrow E\\) Exercise\nExercise 2.1 Specify the candidate keys of the table \\(R\\).\nSolution\nA candidate key is a set of columns that imply all the other columns.\nFirst, let’s try sets composed of only one column: \\(\\{A\\}\\), \\(\\{B\\}\\), \\(\\{C\\}\\), \\(\\{D\\}\\) and \\(\\{E\\}\\).\nWe have the following: (\\(\\{X\\}^+_{\\mathcal{F}}\\) indicates the set of all columns implied by \\(X\\)).\n\\(\\{A\\}^+_{\\mathcal{F}} = \\{A\\}\\)\n\\(\\{B\\}^+_{\\mathcal{F}} = \\{B\\}\\)\n\\(\\{C\\}^+_{\\mathcal{F}} = \\{A, B, C, D, E\\}\\)\n\\(\\{D\\}^+_{\\mathcal{F}} = \\{D, E\\}\\)\n\\(\\{E\\}^+_{\\mathcal{F}} = \\{E\\}\\)\nTherefore, \\(\\{C\\}\\) is a candidate key because it implies all the other columns.\nFrom the functional dependency (1), we obtain that \\(AB\\) implies \\(C\\); therefore, by transitivity they imply all the other columns.\nIn conclusion, we have two candidate keys: \\(\\{C\\}\\) and \\(\\{A, B\\}\\).\nExercise\nExercise 2.2 We assume that \\(R\\) is in 1NF.\nIs table \\(R\\) in 2NF? Justify your answer.\nIs table \\(R\\) in 3NF? Justify your answer.\nIs table \\(R\\) in BCNF? Justify your answer. Solution\n\\(R\\) is in 2NF. In fact, all non-prime columns depend entirely on both candidate keys.\n\\(R\\) is not in 3NF. In fact, the functional dependency \\(D \\rightarrow E\\) is between two non-prime columns.\nAs a result, \\(R\\) is not in BCNF either.\nExercise\nExercise 2.3 If the table \\(R\\) from the previous exercise is not in BCNF, how would you change the schema so that BCNF is satisfied? For each table, specify the primary key and the foreign keys linking the tables to each other.\nSolution\nThe table is not in 3NF. The offending functional dependency is \\(D \\rightarrow E\\).\nWe need to create a new table \\(R_1\\), where the primary key is the determinant in the offending functional dependency (\\(D\\)). We then move all columns that are dependent on \\(D\\) (only \\(E\\) in our case) from \\(R\\) to \\(R_1\\). Note that \\(D\\) is kept in \\(R\\) so that we can use it to link \\(R\\) with \\(R_1\\).\nIn summary:\n\\[R = \\{A, B, C, D\\}\\]\n\\[R_1 = \\{D, E\\}\\]\nThe primary key of \\(R\\) is \\(\\{C\\}\\) (or, we can also choose \\(\\{A, B\\}\\) if we want). The primary key of \\(R_1\\) is \\(\\{D\\}\\).\nThe column \\(D\\) in \\(R\\) is a foreign key referencing the column \\(D\\) in \\(R_1\\).\n3 Question 3 Let \\(R\\) be a relational table with four columns \\((A, B, C, D)\\). \\(\\{A, B\\}\\) is the only candidate key.\nExercise\nExercise 3.1 Identify a minimal set of functional dependencies. Justify your answer.\nSolution\nA candidate key implies all the other columns of the table. Therefore we have :\n\\[AB \\rightarrow C\\] \\[AB \\rightarrow D\\]\nBoth functional dependencies are in canonical form (the right side only consist of one column). Trivially, both functional dependencies are left-irreducible (we cannot remove any of the columns in the determinant without losing information). So, this is a minimal set of functional dependencies.\nExercise\nExercise 3.2 Add \\(B \\rightarrow D\\) to the set of functional dependencies that you identified in the previous exercise. Modify the minimal set of functional dependencies accordingly. Justify your answer.\nSolution\nWe consider the following functional dependencies:\n\\(AB \\rightarrow C\\) \\(AB \\rightarrow D\\) \\(B \\rightarrow D\\) The FD (3) clearly makes FD (2) redundant. By using the augmentation axiom on (3) we obtain:\n\\(AB \\rightarrow AD\\) By applying the decomposition axiom on (4) we obtain:\n\\(AB \\rightarrow A\\)\n\\(AB \\rightarrow D\\)\nWhich shows that (2) is redundant.\nIn summary, we have the following functional dependencies:\n\\[AB\\rightarrow C \\] \\[B\\rightarrow D \\]\nExercise\nExercise 3.3 We assume that \\(R\\) is in 1NF.\nIs table \\(R\\) in 2NF? Justify your answer.\nIs table \\(R\\) in 3NF? Justify your answer.\nIs table \\(R\\) in BCNF? Justify your answer. Solution\n\\(R\\) is not in 2NF. In fact, the non-prime column \\(D\\) is functionally dependent on only one part of the candidate key.\n\\(R\\) is not in 3NF, let alone BCNF, because it doesn’t fulfill the first condition, that is being in 2NF.\nExercise\nExercise 3.4 Normalize \\(R\\) to the BCNF form. Justify your choices.\nSolution\nThe functional dependency that gives a partial dependency is: \\(B \\rightarrow D\\). We create a new table \\(R_1\\), where the determinant (\\(B\\)) of the offending functional dependency is the primary key. We move the columns that depend on \\(B\\) (here, only \\(D\\)) from table \\(R\\) to table \\(R_1\\).\nIn summary:\n\\[R = (A, B, C)\\]\n\\[R_1 = (B, D)\\]\nWe can see that \\(R\\) is in 3NF because:\nThe only non-prime column is \\(C\\), therefore there cannot be any dependency between non-prime columns. \\(R\\) is in BCNF because:\nThe only functional dependency \\(AB \\rightarrow C\\) has a key as its determinant. Similarly, for \\(R_1\\).\n4 Question 4 We consider the following table:\nPatient (ssn, first_name, last_name, phone_number, insurance_number, insurance_expiration_date) where the following set \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) of functional dependencies holds:\nssn -\u0026gt; first_name, last_name, phone_number, insurance_number, insurance_expiration_date insurance_number -\u0026gt; insurance_expiration_date Exercise\nExercise 4.1 Derive a minimal set \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) of functional dependencies that is equivalent to \\(\\mathcal{F}\\). Solution\nFirst, we need to rewrite the FDs in canonical form.\n\\(ssn \\rightarrow first\\_name\\) \\(ssn \\rightarrow last\\_name\\) \\(ssn \\rightarrow phone\\_number\\) \\(ssn \\rightarrow insurance\\_number\\) \\(ssn \\rightarrow insurance\\_expiration\\_date\\) \\(insurance\\_number \\rightarrow insurance\\_expiration\\_date\\) The determinant of each FD is composed of only one column, therefore it is already left-irreducible. It is easy to see that all FDs with ssn as a determinant must be kept (otherwise we lose some information).\nBy transitivity from 4. and 6. we obtain:\n\\[ssn \\rightarrow insurance\\_expiration\\_date\\]\nTherefore, \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) is obtained from \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) by removing 5.\nExercise\nExercise 4.2 Given \\(\\mathcal{G}\\), identify the candidate keys in the table Patient. Solution\nFrom the functional dependencies in \\(\\mathcal{F}\\), it’s easy to see that that the only column that implies all the others is ssn. Therefore, {ssn} is the only candidate key in this table.\nExercise\nExercise 4.3 Specify the normal form of the table Patient. Justify your answer. Solution\nIt is immediate to verify that the table is 1NF.\nThe table is 2NF because there is only one candidate key, which is composed of only one column. Therefore, there cannot be any partial dependency.\nThe table is not in 3NF. Indeed, there is a functional dependency between two non-prime columns:\n\\[insurance\\_number \\rightarrow insurance\\_expiration\\_date\\]\nExercise\nExercise 4.4 How would you normalize table Patient to BCNF? Justify your answer. Solution\nThe offending functional dependency is:\n\\[insurance\\_number \\rightarrow insurance\\_expiration\\_date\\]\nWe need to create another table (let’s call it Insurance) that contains the determinant of the offending functional dependency (insurance_number) as its primary key. We need to move the colum (insurance_expiration_date) that depends on insurance_number from table Patient to table Insurance.\nIn summary:\nPatient (ssn, first_name, last_name, phone_number, insurance_number) Insurance (insurance_number, insurance_expiration_date) Note that the column insurance_number in table Patient is foreign key to the column insurance_number in table Insurance.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"dd4b11df4fa072aaae4db3251396b08d","permalink":"/courses/databases/tutorials/normalization/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/databases/tutorials/normalization/","section":"courses","summary":"Description of the normalization tutorial.","tags":null,"title":"Normalization","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" 1 Computing averages We consider a collection of CSV files containing temperature measurements in the following format:\nyear,month,day,hours,minutes,seconds,temperature\nyou can find the files under the directory hdfs://sar17:9000/data/temperatures/\nHere are the details for each file:\nFile temperatures_86400.csv contains one measurement per day in the years 1980 - 2018. File temperatures_2880.csv contains one measurement every 2880 seconds in the years 1980 - 2018. File temperatures_86.csv contains one measurement every 86 seconds for the year 1980 alone. File temperatures_10.csv contains one measurement every 10 seconds for the years 1980 - 2018. We intend to implement a Spark algorithm to generate pairs \\((y, t_{avg})\\), where \\(y\\) is the year and \\(t_{avg}\\) is the average temperature in the year.\n1.1 First implementation Copy the file /usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_vialle/DCE-Spark/template_temperatures.py to your home directory by typing the following command:\ncp /usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_vialle/DCE-Spark/template_temperatures.py ./avg_temperatures_slow.py\nOpen the file avg_temperatures_slow.py. The file contains the implementation of the function avg_temperature_slow that takes in an RDD where each item is a line of the input text file and returns an RDD, where each item is a key-value pair (year, avg_temp).\nIn the same file, locate the two variables input_path and output-path. and write the following code:\ninput_path = \u0026quot;hdfs://sar17:9000/data/temperatures/\u0026quot; output_path = \u0026quot;hdfs://sar17:9000/bdiaspark22/bdiaspark22_XX/\u0026quot; Replace XX with the number corresponding to your login! Don’t forget the / at the end of the file paths!\nExecute the following actions:\nRun the script avg_temperatures_slow.py by using temperatures_86400.csv as an input. To this extent, use the following command: spark-submit --master spark://sar17:7077 avg_temperatures_slow.py temperatures_86400.csv\nYou should find the output of the program under the folder hdfs://sar17:9000/bdiaspark22/bdiaspark22_XX/temperatures_86400.out Type the following command to verify it : hdfs dfs -ls hdfs://sar17:9000/bdiaspark22/bdiaspark22_XX/temperatures_86400.out\nIf you want to read the result of the computation, you can execute the following command: hdfs dfs -cat hdfs://sar17:9000/bdiaspark22/bdiaspark22_XX/temperatures_86400.out/*\nExercise\nExercise 1.1 What’s the execution time? In the output of Spark on the command line you should see a line that mentions something along the following line:\nINFO DAGScheduler: Job 0 finished: runJob at SparkHadoopWriter.scala:78, took 3.478220 s\nRun the same script by using temperatures_2880.csv as an input.\nWhat is the execution time? Does it seem reasonable compared with the execution time that you observed before? Justify your answer.\nExecute the same script by using temperatures_86.csv as an input.\nWhat is the execution time? How would you justify it, knowing that the files temperatures_2880.csv and temperatures_86.csv have a similar size (11 MB the former, 9 MB the latter)? 1.2 Second implementation Create a copy of avg_temperatures_slow.py and rename it as\navg_temperatures_fast.py, with the following command:\ncp ./avg_temperatures_slow.py ./avg_temperatures_fast.py\nExercise\nExercise 1.2 Open the file and implement the function avg_temperature_fast.\nNOTE. Remember to comment the call to avg_temperature_slow and to uncomment the call to avg_temperature_fast at the end of the file.\nExercise\nExercise 1.3 Run the script avg_temperatures_fast.py by using temperatures_86.csv as an input.\nWhat’s the execution time? Compare it with the execution time obtained in the previous exercise and comment the difference.\nRun the same script by using temperatures_10.csv (3 GB!) as an input. Do you think that the program takes too long? Why?\n2 Common friends in a social network Consider a social network described by a graph encoded in a text file. Each line of the file is a list of identifiers separated by commas. For instance, the line \\(A,B,C,D\\) means that \\(A\\) is friend with \\(B\\), \\(C\\) and \\(D\\). An excerpt of the file looks like as follows:\nA,B,C,D B,A,D C,A,D D,A,B,C ... We suppose that the friendship relation is symmetric: \\((A, B)\\) implies \\((B, A)\\).\nWe want to obtain the list of the common friends for each pair of individuals:\n(A, B), [D] (A, C), [D] (A, D), [B, C] (B, C), [A, D] (B, D), [A] (C, D), [A] As an additional constraint, we want to represent a couple only once and avoid to represent the symmetric couple. In other words, if we output \\((A, B)\\), we don’t want to output \\((B, A)\\).\nWe use the following input files available in folder hdfs://sar17:9000/data/sn/:\nsn_tiny.csv. Small social network, that you can use to test your implementation.\nsn_10k_100k.csv. Social network with \\(10^4\\) individuals and \\(10^5\\) links.\nsn_100k_100k.csv. Social network with \\(10^5\\) individuals and \\(10^5\\) links.\nsn_1k_100k.csv. Social network with \\(10^3\\) individuals and \\(10^5\\) links.\nsn_1m_1m.csv. Social network with \\(10^6\\) individuals and \\(10^6\\) links.\n2.1 Implementation Get the code template with the following commands:\ncp /usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_vialle/DCE-Spark/template_common_friends.py .\nExercise\nExercise 2.1 Write an implementation that uses a reduceByKey.\nWrite an implementation that uses a groupByKey.\nTest both implementations on file sn_tiny.csv. 2.2 Tests and performance measures Exercise\nExercise 2.2 Run both implementations on the other files.\nFill in a table where you indicate: the name and size of each file and the measured running times of both implementations.\n2.3 Minimum, maximum and average degree Exercise\nExercise 2.3 Write a Spark program to compute the minimum, maximum and average degree of a node in the social network. You should use RDDs to do so, don’t try to collect() the content of the RDDs and so compute the values on Python lists.\nCompute the minimum, maximum and average degree for all the given input files.\nComplete the table that you created at the previous exercise by adding the minimum, maximum and average number of friends.\n2.4 Performance analysis Exercise\nExercise 2.4 We suppose that each node has a number of friends that is equal to average number of friends. Compute (with pencil or paper, no need to write a code for that) the number of intermediate pairs \\(((A, B), X)\\) generated by your code.\nComplete the table by writing down the number of intermediate pairs for each file.\nPlot three graphs, where the y-axis has the program running times and the x-axis has: the number of intermediate pairs, the average degree and the file size respectively.\nWhich graphs best predict the evolution of the computational time? 3 Average and standard deviation We use the same files as in the first question. Our objective is to write a Spark program that produces triples \\((y, t_{\\mu}, t_{\\sigma})\\), where \\(y\\), \\(t_{\\mu}\\) and \\(t_{\\sigma}\\) are the year, the average temperature in the year and the standard deviation respectively.\nWe can express the standard deviation of \\(n\\) values \\(x_1 \\ldots x_n\\) with the following formula:\n\\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\overline{x^2} - \\overline{x}^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i)^2}{n} - \\Bigg(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}\\Bigg)^2} \\]\nType the following command to get a code template:\ncp /usr/users/cpu-prof/cpu_vialle/DCE-Spark/template_temperatures.py ./avg_stddev_temp.py\nExercise\nExercise 3.1 Define a new function avg_stddev_temperature in file avg_stddev_temp.py.\nExecute the script and observe the results.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"67f3bc33b5d1da6975469e8a8b62caae","permalink":"/courses/bdia/tutorials/spark-programming-dce/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/bdia/tutorials/spark-programming-dce/","section":"courses","summary":"Description of the tutorial on Spark programming on a cluster","tags":null,"title":"Running Spark programs on a cluster","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Refer to this documentation to learn how to connect and interact with the cluster.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3b9dfc136ad31db433d3400a02f460d5","permalink":"/courses/bdia_old/tutorials/spark-programming-dce/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/bdia_old/tutorials/spark-programming-dce/","section":"courses","summary":"Description of the tutorial on Spark programming on a cluster","tags":null,"title":"Introduction to Spark programming","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial you’ll learn:\nThe key integrity constraints in a relational database. Basic SQL queries. 1 Setting up the environment We use a database managed by a PostgreSQL server. The server runs in a dedicated virtual machine.\nWatch this video to find out how to launch a server and connect to it. The data is already stored at the server.\n2 Description of the data We consider the database of a DVD rental store chain containing data on films, actors, customers and the transactions of the store.\nThis database goes by the name Sakila and was developed by Mike Hillyer, a former member of the MySQL team.\nFigure 2.1: The conceptual schema of the Sakila database The tables of the database are documented on this page.\nSakila has been ported from MySQL to PostgreSQL under the name pagila.\nIn pgAdmin, Open a new query tool to do the exercises.\n3 Integrity constraints Exercise\nExercise 3.1 Execute the following statement:\ninsert into film_actor values(1, 25) What is this statement supposed to do? What is the reaction of the DBMS?\nSolution\nThis statement should insert a new row in table film_actor, where the value of actor_id is 1 and the value of film_id is 25.\nThe DBMS returns an error because there is already a row with these values and the two columns film_actor, film_id form the primary key.\nExercise\nExercise 3.2 Write the statement to delete the film with film_id=1 from the table Film.\nExecute the command. What happens?\nSolution\ndelete from film where film_id=1 The statement is rejected because there are rows in other tables that reference the row that we intend to delete. This is the effect of the foreign key constraint.\nExercise\nExercise 3.3 Look at the definition of the foreign key constraints in table film_actor (right-click on the table, select Constraints, foreign key).\nIs the definition of the foreign key constraint to table film coherent with the behavior observed in the previous exercise?\nNB In order to see the options of a foreign key, click on the edit button on the left of the constraint. Then look at the tab Action.\nSolution\nThe foreign key linking table film_actor to table film is defined with the option RESTRICT on delete. This is coherent with the behavior that we observed in the previous exercise. Referenced rows cannot be deleted if there are still referencing rows.\nExercise\nExercise 3.4 Execute the following query:\nSELECT f.film_id as film_id_in_table_film, fa.film_id AS film_id_in_table_film_actor, fa.actor_id as actor_id, f.title as title FROM film f JOIN film_actor fa USING (film_id) WHERE f.title='ACE GOLDFINGER' What does the query? Note down the identifier of the film in both tables film and film_actor. (columns film_id_in_table_film and film_id_in_table_film_actor).\nSolution\nThe query returns the list of all actors in the film titled Ace Goldfinger. We note that the identifier of the film in both tables is identical (2), as it should because the query joins the two tables on the equality of these two values.\nExercise\nExercise 3.5 Write and execute a statement to set the value 10000 to the identifier of the film ACE GOLDFINGER in table Film.\nAfter the modification, execute the query of the previous exercise. What changed? Explain in details what happened.\nSolution\nThe statement to modify the film_id of the given film is as follows:\nUPDATE film SET film_id=10000 WHERE title=‘ACE GOLDFINGER’ After executing the same query as the previous exercise, we see that the identifier of the film has changed in the table film_actor too. This is expected, because the foreign key constraint between the colum film_id in table film_actor and the column film_id in table film has the option ON UPDATE CASCADE. This means that if we modify the identifier of the film in table film, the modification is propagated to all the referencing columns.\nExercise\nExercise 3.6 Execute the following statement:\nUPDATE film_actor SET film_id=2 WHERE film_id=10000 What does? What happens? Explain.\nSolution\nThe statement intends to set the identifier of the film titled Ace Goldfinger (in the previous exercise we gave it the identifier 10000) back to its original value. However, we execute the statement on the table film_actor. The action is not allowed, as the identifier 2 does not correspond to any film in table film.\nThe foreign key enforces the referential integrity constraint. A row cannot refer to a non-existing entity in the referenced table.\n4 Basic queries Exercise\nExercise 4.1 Write the following SQL queries:\nReturn all the information on all customers.\nReturn the first and last name of all customers.\nReturn the first and last name of all customers of the store with identifier 1. Solution\nselect * from customer select first_name, last_name from customer select first_name, last_name from customer where store_id=1 5 Sorting and paginating Exercise\nExercise 5.1 Write the following SQL queries:\nReturn the last and first name of all customers. Sort by last name in ascending order.\nSame as in 1., but only return the first 100 customers.\nReturn the last and first name of all customers of the store with identifier 1. Sort by last name in ascending order and by first name in descending order. Solution\nselect last_name, first_name from customer order by last_name asc select last_name, first_name from customer order by last_name asc limit 100 select first_name, last_name from customer where store_id=1 6 Aggregating queries Exercise\nExercise 6.1 Write the following SQL queries:\nCount the number of films in the database (expected result: 1000).\nHow many distinct actor last names are there?\nCompute the total amount of payments across all rentals (expected result: 67416.51).\nCompute the average, minimum and maximum duration of rental across all films (expected result: 4.9850000000000000, 3, 7).\nReturn the number of actors for each film.\nReturn the number of copies of each film in each store (table inventory).\nSame as 6., but only returns the pairs (film, store) if the number of copies is greater than or equal to 3.\nSolution\nselect count(*) from film select count (distinct last_name) from actor select sum(amount) from payment select avg(rental_duration), min(rental_duration), max(rental_duration) from film select film_id, count(*) as nb_actors from film_actor group by film_id select film_id, store_id, count(*) as nb_films from inventory group by film_id, store_id select film_id, store_id, count(*) as nb_films from inventory group by film_id, store_id having count(*) \u003e=3 7 Join queries Exercise\nExercise 7.1 Write the following SQL queries:\nReturn the first and last name of the manager of the store with identifier 1 (expected result: Mike Hillyer).\nReturn the first and last name of the actors in the film ACE GOLDFINGER.\nReturn first and last name of each actor and the number of films in which they played a role.\nSame as in 3., but order by number of films in descending order.\nSame as in 4., but only return actors who played a role in at least 10 films.\nReturn the identifier, the first and family name of the customers who have rented between 5 and 10 movies in the category Family.
